that you're asking this question, I can safely assume you haven't died inside yet. Maybe sub to r/2meirl4meirl and become one of us\n\nDating apps are very dehumanizing because you more or less have to itemize and quantify yourself on paper. The more you list, the more other people can be choosy. Problem is that I'm both victim and perpetrator of this behavior. Ive been single for 5.5 yrs, been on this app for most of that time, and I've gone on 3 OKC dates (7 non OKC dates). I personally hate talking to strangers when 1) there's something on the line and 2) when there's pressure to not be boring, so that's another reason I fail.\n\nRambling aside, you'll probably be single awhile so don't lay all your hopes on this. Work towards or at least focus on something else and let this be a side quest for you. Otherwise, you're likely to be disappointed","Ummmm... you do realize that whole idea of OLD is to actually meet people to date in real life.  This reads as if you only plan on dating \"online\" as if in virtual reality.  Maybe I'm missing something, but that's how this comes across.","The apps are more like online matchmaking. You don't date in the app. Okay, maybe some people do. But if you meet a person in a bar, it's not a date yet, it's an introduction.\n\nAnd the people on dating apps are *usually* single, while in real life you might be approaching someone who isn't single, or might not be even remotely compatible. Especially if you're older and everyone's already shacked up.","It's not abnormal in the sense that it's rare, but it *is* generally viewed as uncouth. You are welcome to tell them you want to talk a little first. That is the norm and it's perfectly acceptable to require at least a little back and forth communication before committing to meet someone in person. It's just a way to quickly gauge compatibility a little so that you both can avoid wasting each other's time and be more comfortable.\n\nYou're also perfectly within your rights to just not reply (as you are to any message), since they are acting out of the norm and it's to be expected that such is gonna make people uncomfortable.\n\nAll that said, I do also want to point out that meeting up in public is very safe. Just be sure to use your own transportation, be mindful of alcohol consumption, watch your drinks, and preferably be at least a little familiar with where you're meeting. A lot of people new to online dating are somewhat strangely afraid of meeting people in person. There's actually an OkCupid question that asks how willing you are to meet in person. I've seen people answer this question as \"I'm not\" and it always made me wonder what they hope to get out of the site. Most definitely the typical end goal of how the site is to meet in person. And millions of people have. Of course, choose your own pace, but I do encourage you to not be afraid to meet people if you think they're interesting. There's only so much you can do over text messages and you also run the risk of alienating people if you wait *too* long to meet.","People love using the introvert label to describe themselves, but it's not actually all that meaningful and people use it in a lot of different ways. What does that word mean to you? Do you prefer to spend a lot of time alone? Do you have social anxiety? Are you indoorsy? Do you prefer only spending time with people one on one instead of in groups? Do you prefer your time spent around someone else to contain a lot of silence? Do you have difficulty opening up to people?  Like where do you actually anticipate this being a problem?","Many people, I think, make the mistake of not giving the other person something to build on, whether it be in communicating or in activities. They answer the question or the date without creating opportunities to keep the conversation going or spark interest in another date. And then they wonder why the other person isn't communicating back. \n\nSome people do this out of fear of vulnerability, some are just boring people and some just don't know how to communicate or plan, but the result is still the same: the other person interprets it as you're not that interested and for whatever reason, they don't invest. \n\nDating is hard AF. Make it easy for the person you're interested in to keep the momentum going. When the other person gets the feeling they have to do all the work, they end up not doing it and whatever you might have had, never gets started in the first place. \n\nI do agree that if someone legitimately likes you, they will make time. **HOWEVER**, that is predicated on their belief that you are also interested as well. You gotta get past that first stage of shitty uncertainty about both of your feelings before that stereotype applies. And that means making it easy to keep the momentum alive until you have some form of DTR where both parties make it clear what their intentions and feelings are for each other.","&amp;gt; Wondering if this transition is typical given the recent changes.\n\nThat's just the nature of becoming a realist on online dating. You initially spend lots of time reading, searching and getting invested. That degrades until you're barely checking it at all and when you do, you regret opening the app in the first place.\n\nIt's time you took a break from at least OKC. Try Coffee Meets Bagel. Takes about 5 seconds a day. ","Truly I wish you well and am happy for you, but I always feel my eyes roll at these posts where the OP meets someone and is suddenly ascended to a higher plane above those who use dating apps. You don't form a connection through an app, you use an app to meet people you might find attractive and then you form a connection when you meet them... \n\n&amp;gt;here's to finding people in real life. Who the fuck knew that was possible.\n\nEveryone before 1995 when Match.com went live, and also everyone currently?","Hard to take a review seriously coming from someone who clearly detests the very idea of dating apps. Maybe even the idea of dating.\n\nSo you went into it kicking and screaming, refusing to put in any real effort, and condescending on the process the whole while? Who would have thought that wouldn't be pleasant? /S\n\nThis coming from someone (me) deeply skeptical of Facebook hosting any kind of dating.\n\nAlso, how is she so ignorant that she can't even comprehend the good dating apps do? She even calls out the catcalls and stuff you put up with in real life. Not everyone meets a lot of people organically in their daily life. I much prefer to meet in a forum specifically designated and mutually used for dating pickups. As opposed to a bar or an unsolicited cold pickup in person where you make the person a potentially involuntary victim of your advances.","This article kinda hits on it but doesn't go all the way, I agree with \nu/captchyanotapassword here. It's about being willing to be different, have differing opinions, and expressing polarizing views. A lot of nice guys tend to also be extremely \"agreeable\" and go along with whatever the girl says, feigning interest in what she likes and scared to differ in opinion. I've told most people close to me about polarization being an important part of my dating approach. Flat out, it's more interesting when people take strong and/or controversial stances and they're confident in what they think/believe, it makes them different and sets them apart. It also displays you don't need or seek the approval of others, but you're confident in your own convictions and who you are. I'd rather risk distancing someone and be open, honest and communicative than keep things to myself just to keep someone around. \n\nI thought Mark Manson's book Models did a great job of talking about this via \"receptive\", \"neutral\" and \"unreceptive\" women. He set out percentages that in my experience seem fair about how women see you at first. 10% are receptive, meaning it's kinda hard to screw things up at first because they're really into you. These women make their interest quite obvious. 40% are unreceptive, and you can't do much of anything to change that. Who cares why, she's just not interested, you move on. The remaining 50% are undecided and \"neutral\". Being a \"nice guy\" isn't going to get you anywhere with women who are currently undecided/neutral on you, since you won't set yourself apart from the crowd. Being polarizing, in general, will make women (and people) either more or less receptive to you, which makes it easier to know how to proceed. If she's more receptive, great, she thinks you're pretty interesting and she's into you! If she's less receptive, you find out she's not a good match which helps you to not spend time with someone that's not right with you.\n\nThe easiest way to sum it up, \"nice guys\" are SELLING themselves to dates and fear rejection, pushing forward with anyone, even a girl who's clearly not receptive towards them. Meanwhile interesting people know their worth, are polarizing, and are BUYING stock only in people who are receptive towards them.","1.

When we first met (early January), we scheduled going to a local show, but the day of the event, she canceled saying she had an eye infection, but that she was legitimately sorry and that it \"wasn't a lame excuse,\" and that she would text me back when she was feeling better.  \n\nA month later, and there is an event at a nerd bar that sounded like a lot of fun so I texted her asking if she wanted to go.  She mentioned she was still fighting the eye infection, and that she was traveling out of the country and wasn't sure when she would be back, so she said she would text me back when she got back into town. \n\nAnother month goes by.  Last weekend, I went to a beer festival with a bunch of friends, and the Friday before I decided to randomly text her and see if she wanted to go with me. She said she already made plans, but she said that she really wants to hang out with me once she gets back in town from traveling africa/the uk, europe)  I asked her how her travels went, but she said she had to make dinner and go to work.  Mind you, this was at around 7 at night my time, which led me to conclude that she was no longer out of the country and came back into town, but NEVER let me know.  Needless to say, I am extremely annoyed by her.  It's one thing to pull off the fade and be noncommittal, but to her to keep emphasizing how much she wants to see me and is looking forward to hanging out, while at the same time continuing to lead me on is really pushing my buttons (and that's a hard thing to do to me.)\n\nThat, coupled with not being able to meet anyone at the bodybuilding show two weekends ago along with someone that my coworker is trying to set me up with also being noncommittal and flaky is really beating me down.","Dating life has definitely been a desert as of late.  A woman I matched with at a speed dating event two weekends ago is still fighting off an infection.  I text her occasionally, and she says she will let me know when she is better because she is really wants to see me again, but honestly, I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much and am trying to keep my expectations in check.  \n\nA coworker of mine who is trying to set me up with a friend of her's let me know that she is very interested in me and wants to go out with me.  However, said coworker said that her friend is currently moving, and that once she is done she will text me (my coworker gave her my number.)  That was four weeks ago, and haven't heard anything yet, so again, trying to keep my expectations in check.  \n\nHonestly, I've just been feeling very lonely the past couple of months.  Therapist has definitely been helping me out, but I've been struggling with feeling discouraged.  I haven't been active on OKC since they have made their changes with messaging, so I'm going to try and find ways to meet people outside of online.  I think I'm going to join a Crossfit gym for that.  \n\nNow I'm leaving for a leg workout at gym, and I think I will have Chinese food for a cheat meal.","This was not a good week dating/relationship wise.\n\nFirst off, a geek-themed speed dating event scheduled yesterday was canceled due to low numbers, and the organizer said that she probably wouldn’t schedule another event.  I’m so bummed out because it probably would have been a good chance to find people who are into fandoms like me.  Plus, the first event they had back in April I had to miss due to it being scheduled the same night as Infinity War.  Now I really regret seeing the movie instead of going to the event.\n\nMy old FWB came into town.  When we first met while she was living here getting treatment for Lupus last year, we had the most amazing chemistry, and the intimacy we shared was incredible.  I was so excited to see her.  However, she seemed kind of out of it the two times we hung out.  The first night, we cuddled, but didn’t have sex because she said she was cramping really bad due to an IUD she had put in.  \n\nThe second day, when I picked her up, she looked very out of it, and she told me she was very stoned.  She said she smoked as much as she did for her joint pain, but it was very hard to converse with her.  We had dinner and ice cream, and then we went back to my place where she laid down on the couch watching Rouge One, not really wanting to cuddle or anything like that.  Finally, we get to the bedroom, and cuddle for a bit before she tells me that she wasn’t in the mood again for anything further.  She said ever since she got the IUD, her libido tanked (a far contrast from when she lived here last year when she always wanted to jump my bones).  She said she was sorry for feeling awful and being so out of it, but I felt crushed.  I asked her if it had anything to do with me, and she insisted it was nothing I did.\n\nWith everything that has happened dating wise over the past few months: getting stood up, getting flaked, getting led on, getting hurt over and over again, I kind of broke down.  I’m 99% positive she’s being honest with me, but after my past experiences with other women hurting me, I had a nagging thought that it really was me, and that I wasn’t attractive to her or desirable anymore, or that I did something that turned off her want for me.  With everything compounded, I honestly felt broken, and I haven’t felt that in awhile.\n\nMy new therapist asked me, when we were talking about dating, about maybe getting friends to set me up.  I told him that while I have a pretty good social circle, no one really knows anyone who is single and a good match for me.  Reflecting on that also hurt me even more.  It hurts even more when I feel like I am giving it the best I can to improving myself and being the best version of myself.\n\nI spent most of Saturday morning watching morbid, dark and depressing movies like Antichrist and I See the Devil, before going to the r/Vegas Meetup and hanging out with a couple friends.  Doing the latter really helped me, and while I still feel a lot of pain, it helped me at least enjoy myself for a bit.\n\nI know it sounds lame, but I really could use a kind word or some encouragement.  I feel beyond sad right now, and I can’t get these thoughts out of my head that I’m unlovable, undesirable and all that fun stuff.","There was to be a Geek-themed speed dating event next weekend, and I was very excited for it and even practiced a bit for it (for the record, there was a previous event last month, but I missed it because it was on the same day that the Avengers hit theaters.  Sadly, I got an email this morning saying that due to low registration numbers, the event was canceled. I want to say that it doesn’t bother me, but I’m really, really bummed out. I’m really burnt out on things not working out the way I hope, even when I try and put myself out there. I get that there are no guarantees in things working out, or that you can do all the right things and still not get the result you hoped, but I just want something to go right for a change!  \n\nA coworker of mine told me about a friend of her’s that she is a bit hesitant to set me up with because, in her words “I am worried you’re too good for her.”  She is very cute and is into fitness, but my friend said that because she is apparently a little ditzy and very flaky, but I still said yes.  I admit that flakiness is one of things that irritates me the most, along with ditziness, but maybe giving her a chance wouldn’t hurt. \n\nWell, at least I have a book club meeting coming up next week.  It will be the last one in awhile as the bookstore that hosts it is moving locations, and while I haven’t found any dates on it, I have met some really awesome people.  \n\nEdit: I’m also thinking about getting back on Fetlife and involved with the kink community, but my previous experience was a bit meh.  You would figure that in my city there would be a very large kink community, but there really isn’t.  I am struggling to find the motivation to get back into it, and as someone who is normally a go-getter, it’s really frustrating.","I finally got a match with someone I really liked at a Speed Dating event (my third one,) and we were supposed to go out to a geek-themed bar on Friday night (she is also heavily into fandom culture.). Unfortunately, she had to cancel due to coming down with an infection.  She sounded very apologetic and insisted it wasn’t an excuse, but I’m still a bit bummed out.  I’m going to reach out to see if she wants to go out next weekend.\n\nYesterday I wound up running into a woman that didn’t match with me (I selected yes) at the same speed dating event at the gym yesterday.  I said hi to her, and definitely didn’t mention her not picking me (I wanted to show confidence that I wasn’t bothered.). Her two friends that she was with, a bodybuilder and a powerlifter, were definitely more attractive to me than her, and I’m hoping I can develop a rapport with them and maybe ask one of them out.\n\nOn the plus side, I hit new bests for my back squat and bench press.  I’m ending the week by going to go to a bar to watch playoff football with my roommate, and then I’m going to finish reading *All The President’s Men*.","I gave one last shot with the flaky girl that my [coworker tried to set me up with almost three months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/891f8t/cj_let_the_sub_make_a_decision_for_you/dwol5xf/).  Long story short, she was busy with a move, texted me because my coworker prompted her to letting me know she isn't ignoring me, then a month later I tried asking her to a beer festival, was told she was busy but she was closing her house that weekend and that she will text me so we could go for drinks, and still haven't heard from her since. I gave it one last shot by texting her yesterday morning asking her out to an arts festival in the downtown area, but I haven't gotten a response yet. Looks like instead of saying she's busy, she decided to straight ghost me. \n\nI'm sad and hurt because I feel pretty led on (she texted me saying she was interested and wanted to get drinks,)  I also feel a bit upset at my coworker (who I am close friends with) for trying to set me up with her.  I expressed my concerns about that person's flakiness numerous times, and (my coworker) would always respond with \"no, she's interested!\" and \"I know her, she is very honest and wouldn't lie if she wasn't into going on a date with you.\"  I don't mind rejection at all, but I STRONGLY despise getting led on.  \n\nNow I don't know whether to let her know that if she isn't interested she should just tell me instead of being flaky, or if I should just delete her number. ","Been talking to my new therapist a lot about dating, especially about how downright depressing dating apps can be at times (for some background, he is in a domestic partnership with another man, and has never actually done online dating before.). He looked through some of my profiles (Tinder and Bumble) and told me they look pretty good, but that again, since I am looking for someone rather specific that it is probably going to take some time before I find that right person.  He says I’m doing all the right things (expanding my social circle, staying fit, etc ,) and while I know that sometimes you can do all the right things and not get the result you want, it can still be discouraging at times.  \n\nSpeaking of dating apps, the last few days of browsing them have been a bit a downer.  There really aren’t many people that are my type, and the ones I swiped and/or messaged haven’t matched me back or responded yet.  I actually do know of a couple people who are interested in me, but I am honestly not physically attracted to them at all and I feel so guilty about it.  I’m debating whether I should give them a shot anyway to see if maybe I can grow and develop some kind of attraction to them, or if it would just be cruel and a waste of their time.  \n\nOn the non-dating realm, I am a week into Crossfit and am loving it so far.  Each workout has royally smoked me, but it’s awesome to learn new skills and techniques, and the people at the gym I go to have been extremely friendly and welcoming.  I also spent some time with friends this week, and it’s helped keep my mind of dating for a bit.) Still, I’m feeling that yearning in my heart.","Honestly, this was a bit of a rough weekend on the dating front, and I could definitely use some advice or a pick me up.\n\nPer my therapist’s suggestion (along with some other people and friends,) in the continuing quest to meet a swolemate (and also network with the bodybuilding community,) I went to a local bodybuilding show for the first time yesterday.  The evening already started bad; what was to be only a 25 minute drive turned into over an hour due to road closures that my GPS didn’t reflect, so I barely got there in time for the show.  When I got there, I noticed that almost all the people there didn’t really give off a vibe of wanting to meet or network with people.  They mostly just kept to themselves, or within the groups that they were with.  \n\nI did try to start conversations with two ladies there, though, but neither seemed interested in talking to me so I quickly stopped and went away.  One was a competitor who was in the bikini competition, but when I congratulated her on her placement and asked her how her prep went, she only gave quick answers before going back to her phone.  Another was an absolutely gorgeous non-competitor (muscular, tall, lots of tattoos,) wearing a hoodie that promoted a personal training service.  I introduced myself, and asked her about her programs.  She quickly said to check the website, and then went back to conversing with her group.  Seeing that I probably wasn’t going to get anywhere, I left at the end of the Men’s physique competition (the women went first.)\n\nI went home pretty depressed and defeated.  I know that no one is obligated to meet new people or start conversations with people they don’t know, but I admit to feeling sad that I didn’t reach my goal of meeting any new people (and my goal of getting at least one number.).  I don’t know how to “get in” into the bodybuilding community.  Do I need to compete?  Join a hardcore gym?  There is another competition coming up at the end of the Month (a bigger one, the Jay Cutler classic) but I don’t know if it would be worth going.  All I can think about is that I could have got something nice for myself for the $45 I spent on the ticket to the show.  \n\nI went home, got a Jimmy John’s sandwich and watched a B Horror movie to help me feel better.\n\nTL:DR: Went to bodybuilding show to try to get out there to meet a swolemate, got shut down twice, no one really seemed like they wanted to chat with new people, left feeling defeated and went home to a sandwich and a horror movie.","* the lady I had the really good second date with decided to move early instead of a few weeks from now. I knew we couldn’t have a relationship because we don’t want to do the LDR thing, but it sucks that I wasn’t able to see her again. She said she would be visiting in a few months, though.\n\n* I overheard my roommate banging his fwb last night. I don’t mind at all, but it made me feel a bit lonely. I’ve been doing better with my happiness as a single guy with some help from my therapist and my hobbies, but sometimes you get reminders of your singleness and that sucks. It was especially worse because my libido has been in overdrive all week for some reason.\n\n* I’m taking a break from online dating and am instead trying to broaden my social circle and see if I can meet people from that. Psycho Vegas is this weekend, so maybe I can meet some cool metalheads.\n\n* been going to Crossfit 5 days a week and have been slowly building friendships with the people there. I didn’t join for the sole purpose of finding a date, but it would be really, really cool to meet my swolemate there. I am a bit nervous about the potential awkwardness, though, especially if someone rejects me. I don’t mind getting turned down, but the last thing I want to do is make someone else feel uncomfortable and awkward.\n\n","Down to my lowest weight since college at 174 lbs. At my heaviest before I got back into a fit lifestyle I was almost at 200. The goal is to now reach 160 (while still retaining as much strength as I can)\n\nThis week was a bit rough, but got some much-needed hangout time with my roommate/best friend yesterday. \n\nAll apps are still deleted. Still trying to do the whole meet people organically and in-person kind of thing, so seeing if I would have more success doing that, especially doing my regular hobbies (crossfit, book club, gaming meetups, concerts, etc.) So far, nothing yet, but I’m trying to be patient.\n\nI know I’m being a bit pickier than I used to be, but I know what I want and I don’t want to settle. Furthermore, I’m trying to get into a mentality that I also have a lot to offer, and that when it comes to dating, I should also go into the headspace of “I’m looking to see if they are good enough for me” instead of “I hope that she likes me back!”\n\nEDIT: if you’re curious, [this is my latest progress pic from last Tuesday ](https://imgur.com/a/lpC6wX5) ","&amp;gt;Anyway, I'm crying way more than I expected but it could be the alcohol\n\nFrom experience, booze really brings me down. It's not that it makes our feelings invalid, it just makes it hard to take on an optimistic counter-view when things are hard. I recommend staying away from alcohol for a few days after a breakup to recalibrate. \n\n&amp;gt;I just can't help but feel like something is wrong with me even though I know that I'm a fucking catch for someone who's like willing to stick around.\n\nIt's actually a deep-set biological reaction to feel this way. The emotion, shame, is hard-wired in us when we get rejected because it instills a desire to maintain part of the community. Back in the days when being out of the tribe meant being a lion snack, this was a very useful driver. These days, it just colors our worldview and self-perception to make us feel unlovable (even when we rationally know this is false). \n\nOne trick I've learned: When you feel unlovable, acknowledge the feeling (don't push back on it), recognize it's *just* a feeling (caused by our biology) &amp;amp; doesn't mean anything real, and then remember that basically everyone goes through that same feeling at some point or another. Try to visualize the brighter days when you'll look back on this moment and think *Damn, that was rough, but it's so much better now.*\n\n&amp;gt;I have a hard time connecting with people, I know this. \n\nI don't know your history or life experience, but as someone who grew up in a terrible home with lots of abandonment issues, defaulting to this mindset comes naturally. However, I don't think it's actually a true belief. If you're an empathetic person, you have passions and thoughts and interests in the world, I don't believe you can't connect with others (even if it feels that way). \n\n&amp;gt;Fam, I need a hug.\n\n*hugs* Just remember there are people right now who you've never even met, and still care deeply about your well-being and happiness, and accept you just the way you are.  \n\n\nNB: This sounds super hippie-dippie, but as someone who registers \"very skeptical\" on the rational/emotional thinking spectrum, I've actually found that [Metta exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett%C4%81) do wonders after a tough breakup. ","It really is difficult to get over self esteem issues. I can't really give perfect advice because I admit that I have those problems myself and am still dealing with them. But what does work for me sometimes is just *pushing myself*. Yeah, I know \"just do it\" isn't magical advice, but it's like ripping off a bandaid. It *is* hard and it does take you out of your comfort zone. But it only takes a second to like someone or shoot off a message. So you only have to deal with that discomfort for a moment.\n\nAnd then once it's over, I find that I'm usually happy with myself. Yeah, it was awkward and uncomfortable but hey, I just did something that conquered an insecurity (or fear or anxiety)! It's a tiny thing, but it does feel like an achievement. And I mean, when that tiny thing keeps you wracking your brain or posting on reddit for advice, it's not that tiny anymore, is it?\n\nDo that enough times and it does get easier. And you do get more comfortable with specific people. Myself, I always found my insecurities are at their worst with strangers and their best with my partner and family.\n\nAnd yeah, sometimes you'll embarrass yourself. I've done that so many times. It sucks, but just something you have to deal with to get what you want. And personally, I like being in a relationship.

One big and annoying problem is it can sap motivation to do exactly the sort of things that will make you fell better.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it's up to the person who is sick to make the effort to get better - to take medication and to continue taking medication when symptoms go away (\"I haven't had a depressive episode in years, do I still need these?\" - almost certinaly *yes*), to have already committed effort to try and mitigate the illness.  In that regard it's not fair for them to ask or need a partner to do that for them (which is really just codependence).  Still a little bit of understanding and reinforcment from people who are close can go a long way to making it an easier illness to manage.  ","Maybe?  But it really doesn't matter.  You didn't do anything *awful*.  You won't be her dating horror story.\n\nThere's one thing you can take from this that will save you a fuckton of time: When someone tells you what they're like, listen, and don't try to rationalize it away.\n\nYou should know about Attachment Theory.  I wish I did a long time ago.  [Here's the most easy-to-read guide to it.](https://markmanson.net/attachment-theory)  Don't worry, it's not a PUA thing, it just proposes that there are three different ways people approach relationships, and it sounds like you were an anxious and she was an avoidant.  \n\nThose of us with anxious personality types tend to be drawn to avoidants, and for young guys, it's often the Ramona Flowers types who are colorful, interesting, and confident, but at the same time, intimidatingly cool and mysterious.  (I don't particularly like Scott Pilgrim or her as a character, but it's one of the more popular examples of the archetype.)  They tend to go for you hard and make things sexual fast, and regardless of looks, make you feel like you scored someone way above your league.  But they also cut ties and move on just as easily, probably because people like them attract loads of potential partners and aren't interested in anything committed.  I don't know why that particular relationship pattern happens so often.  I wish I did.\n\nBut hopefully, from now on, you'll learn that either:\n\nA.  Avoidant personality types aren't for you.\n\nor\n\nB.  You'll have to totally change your attachment style, which takes years of work and maybe therapy, to land one.\n\nI prefer A.  Avoidants will usually tell you that they're avoidant early on, either by saying they're finicky with relationships, mentioning they've dumped tons of people in the past, or bragging about how \"good\" they are at cutting people out of their lives.  I've learned to run out of the room and jump into the nearest taxi when a date starts talking that kind of shit.\n\nSigned: Someone who's fucked up multiple relationships far, *far,* **far** worse than this, some more recently than I'd like to admit.","What one person considers comforting could be patronizing to another, it really varies a lot. I'll write some vague tips that probably apply generally. (source: too many)\n\nHow to behave with them:\n\n- be patient\n- don’t bring it up constantly or in arguments unless it’s actually relevant\n- avoid blunt dismissive language (calm down, get over it, etc.)\n- affection and empathy will probably help more than logic\n- light socialization (isolation is commonly sought but seldom helpful)\n- breaking routine a bit (doesn’t have to be anything big, a walk in a park, getting junk food, etc.)\n- don’t pressure for treatment (there are some obvious exceptions to this) \n\n\nFrom your perspective:\n\n- don't take it personally (this is *way* easier said than done, but it's important to keep reminding yourself)\n- be mindful of your own emotional state (this is mostly relevant if you're living together, you might need to distance yourself for short periods if you find their negativity is dragging you down)\n- it can help to think of the other person like a child in some situations. This might sound odd and condescending, but it's just a trick to help change your perspective. The idea is not to think of them as a literal child, but rather that your instincts for handling a child's emotions are much more appropriate for some situations than your instincts for handling those of an adult. When we interact with children, we tend to be far more empathetic by default because we start on the premise that they cannot manage their emotions so arguing with them about their emotions seems pointless. If an adult has extended periods with severe emotions they cannot manage at all (depression, anger issues, whatever), they are (temporarily) more similar to a child emotionally than an adult.","I won't date a religious person - I specifically seek out other atheists. Why? I grew up religious and it really fucked with me, and I just don't feel like I can truly connect with someone who doesn't have an atheist view of the universe. \n\nA little bit of openness and philosophical exploration of various spiritual ideas is cool (personally, I'm interested in Daoism) but I really can't take a belief in god/s seriously. It doesn't matter to me if people in general are religious, and I actually appreciate some specific things about religion as far as community goes. *But* I feel like it's unfair to my partner if there is something about their core beliefs that I find ridiculous or fake or whatever. So I stick with atheists. \n\nBasically, It matters to me that we can really connect on the deepest parts of our understanding of reality &amp;amp; human nature and all that. I feel I'll only really get that with an atheist.\n\n\n","I feel for Incels, to an extent at least. I think we all know of someone who is a genuinely good person, but just can’t talk to girls due to insecurities or social awkwardness. I can think of a handful from high school and college. I was a late bloomer and didn’t have a first kiss until 25. There’s a lot of anxiety and insecurity when you see so much love and passion around you and you don’t even know the feeling. \n\nGranted, I never blamed women for my shortcomings. I knew it was on me and I forced myself to change, physically and mentally. But I understand more than anyone that it’s a tough hole to dig yourself out of. It’s easier to blame women and yell into the void. So I feel for the incels, and I hope they learn that the way out of being an incel is self-love and not being negative.\n\nAnd honestly, while I hate the anti-woman shit I see upvoted on this subreddit everyday, we could all be a little more understanding of the incel. They are a human being and they are hurting emotionally.","Just to provide a counterpoint to the sitcom level take here on the male female relationship - I am a guy who actually doesn't like to sleep with a woman in early dates. I am in no way religious or prudish. I don't have a germ thing and I love to touch people.\n\nI just think sex is an expression of intimacy and that takes a little time to develop. I don't need to be ankle deep inside some girl as soon as I meet her. That seems uncomfortable and weird. \n\nI've had some amount of casual sex and it just isn't for me. I get why people like it. I just don't. It frankly makes me feel kind of shallow and empty, and sex with someone too soon feels very similar.\n\nSo to answer the question from my own perspective: You might get lucky if I seem really comfortable, you've indicated that you are at least in this for a few more dates, and I'm giving physical queues that I am interested. And even then if I am being honest, there's a good chance that bringing me home won't lead to sex because I still might not feel ready.\n\nNot saying a lot of guys are like me, but I do insist that there are more than are willing to admit it.","If she's cool with it, put your dick in her. That definitely gets a fire going.\n\nSerious answer, after the first date feel free to text more than just making plans. You WOULD seem like someone dating hella people/not looking for something super serious. Women likely think you're not that into them or a backup plan, so as a result they lose interest in you and turn their attention toward others. There is no texting rule. You only seem clingy when you texts multiple times a day with no response. Like if I send a girl three texts back to back at the same time, that's fine. That is assuming their short messages all related and I just didn't want to send one massive block. But if I text a girl three different times throughout the day with no response, that seems clingy. Example, \"Hey good morning, I hope you have a great day.\" In the afternoon, \"I just checked my schedule and would be free next tuesday or wednesday if you wanted to do X.\" That night, \"Oh man I just saw the Last Jedi, it was so good have you seen it?\" See how that is needy/clingy? Now compare that to, \"Hey good morning, I hope you have a good day.\" Immediately followed by, \"Also you were right, it did rain, I'm glad I wore a coat.\" Then finished with \"So I haven't had sushi in a while and am definitely craving it. I have to go next week, care to come with?\" 3 texts, but all back to back, vs 3 spread out.\n\nTl;dr - If you're into someone, text them and just ask how their day is going or something you two have talked about to let them know you're thinking about them in between the dates.","As a guy, every time one of my dates has paid for her own meal she never goes for a second date and ghosts.

I had a friend I talked to everyday, then one day she just stopped talking to me. And of course when we see each other in person she just acts like nothing happened.

Okay...","The only time I didn't pursue a second date with someone was with this girl who was Ok but, well this is gonna sound mean but she has Celiac disease.  \n\nThe conversation often seemed to flow back to that and then a day or two after the first date she texted me about her health issues which I thought was weird.\n\nI wasn't super into it, I thought the focus on her health issues was weird, and I was pretty busy, so I just kind of let the talking die out.","This article was actually fascinating to me. Although she gets an allowance, her and her friends are incredibly conscious about spending money and paying each other back for the smallest things. She is the definition of basic, but seems so grateful for her friend's house and Hamptons experience. But then vacations give her panic attacks?

No wonder she found it hard to date, go try Staten Island, girl.

Everyone does it, and unless you *define* yourself by your job, it just leaves me yawning. Following it with the fact that you *don't* worship your job just leaves me asking \"so what?\" by the end. \n\nHere's some more concrete advice: use action language, not \"to be\" language. It will empower your text. So instead of \"I'm an assistant VP at blah,\" say \"As an assistant VP at blah, I help ensure financial stability of your checking account ;)\" (don't make it that cheesy, but you get the idea).

Was the angle humor here as well? You could punch it up considerably with something like this: \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\"In case you were wondering, I've got all the essentials of a grown up: a $200k degree (debt not included!), my 9-5 that pays those bills, wheels (tricycles count, right?), and an overpriced apartment chosen only so I could impress you.\" \n\n\n&amp;gt;I don't have kids or crippling student loan debt.\n\nYou have a limited amount of time and space to introduce yourself and this is what you lead with? The kids thing is another obvious fact from the right column. The debt thing doesn't tell me anything about you, except maybe that you had an easy life. Did you pay off the debt yourself? Tell me about that. Did your parents or a benefactor? Share about how they mean a lot to you or something. \n\n&amp;gt;I am looking for a women to enjoy movies, tv show binge watch marathons, coffee dates, late night food runs, and ultimately a happy future with together; a woman who is independent but empathetic, supportive but also knows when to challenge and push for what she deserves, and whose end goal playing this manic dating game is to find a true partner. Most importantly, I am seeking someone who wants their other half to help them be who they are meant to be, without reservation or judgement, and who will provide the same for me.\n\nHere's the thing, I'm looking for all the exact same things in a woman. But if you want someone of that caliber, you have to \"put out\" that you're also capable of providing those qualities *to her*. Your profile doesn't (yet) display those qualities, so it comes across as somewhat demanding/overly picky to list these all out. \n\nYou want independence and empathy? Show more of that than \"I walk dogs and don't have debt.\" Show us how you push yourself (not to be overly harsh, but 4x of exercise a week doesn't really cut it in my book). On the whole though, it's a sweet summary and at least you're clear about what you want. Women will appreciate that. \n\nAnd that pun thing? Add it here at the end: \"I'm also *banking* on a shared love of puns ;)\"","Kids are a definite deal breaker for me and many others, not just because I don't want kids, but also the fact that yours is so young guarantees at least 15 years of dealing with your ex.

Do you have Facebook? Instagram? Crop out any excess people, or if you post a group pic, add a caption stating which one is you. And make sure none of your friends are hotter than you. Seriously.\n\nApart from that, you mentioned your text game is not strong - this is pretty crucial to work on, since you need to chat with someone via text or messaging before they'll agree to meet you in person. If they think you're boring based on your text conversations, why would they want to meet? Practice is key here - eventually it will become more natural to you. Pick conversation topics from their profiles if you can. Comment on their favorite books/movies, or ask a question about any hobbies they have listed. \n\nYes, women get way more messages than men, but the vast majority are \"hey/hi\" or obvious copy/paste messages that they're sending to every woman on the site. If I get a message that's actually personalized to me and shows that the guy read my profile rather than just looked at the pics, I'm at least 10x more likely to respond. Also use those writing skills in your own profile - blank profiles are boring and make you seem lazy, and ones that say \"anything you want to know just ask\" are worse. Give the ladies some possible conversation starters too. \n\nHope this helps; good luck out there.","It's common for most males to not get a lot of matches.

They are a human being and they are hurting emotionally.","do what you can\n\nFirst fix your shit. \n\n1. Do you have acne? Forget wasting money on proactiv, go to your doctor and get them to prescribe you the good stuff\n2. Wear glasses? Get lasik\n3. Have crooked teeth? Get invisilign\n4. Have yellow teeth? Get whitening strips\n5. Start going to the gym for at least 30 minutes a day...but forget about doing cardio which is one of the slowest ways to lose weight, and instead focus that time entirely on lifting weights...so you get the best of both worlds\n6. Upgrade your warddrobe, you don't need to spend a lot of money, but buying new clothes that actually fit and look good can help you get a lot of confidence \n\nNext, psych yourself up:\n\n1. You need to understand that if you think its bad for you, its a 100x worse for the woman. You need to realize that its a MASSIVE hit to a woman's self esteem to be on a dating site. Resorting to using dating sites is a massive admission of failure in attracting a man via traditional means. Thats why pretty much every girl will have \"my friends made me do it\" or \"I can't believe I'm doing this\" or \"if anyone asks, we'll say we met at whole foods\". They are downright ashamed of it. So if you ever feel bad, realize that she has it a LOOOT worse than you\n2. Next you need to realize, that no matter how \"good\" the profiles look, most of it is bullshit. People lie on dating sites more than they do on Facebook and Instagram. A bank teller will say they work in finance. That \"CEO\" is a guy who setup a squarespace website, with \"Send me $1 to 123 Fake Street\" plastered all over it. That \"model\" probably had 1 paying gig this month, and made a whopping $300. Those happy, interesting photos, were probably taken over the course of the last 15 years, and were staged to be more interesting than the vacation was. And that intimidating profile, is mostly bullshit. Noone's life is as interesting, as how they portray it on their dating profiles. The girl who says that she likes to spend every evening sitting on couch, sipping some wine, while reading the latest philosophical text, most likely just did that once in the past month, and the wine came in a box, the book was a copy of Cosmo and sitting on the couch was her sitting on the floor crying about the fact that she is still single. The guy who talks about living life and taking advantage of everything that life has to offer, most likely spends most of his free time playing video games while working some shit job. \n3. So once you realize everyone else is full of shit, you can stop being so intimidated by others. ","My best advice is to just finish your drink and leave. There are a lot of liars when it comes to online dating. I once went out with a man who used pictures of his more attractive brother because they \"looked so much alike\" (he admitted this on the date). First of all, no, they looked alike in the sense that I could see they share some similar features but the brother was MUCH more attractive! And second, it's not ok to use pics of someone else. \n\nI understand why people do it, because some people won't care...but most will. However for some people it's easier to be dishonest. \n\nYou don't need to waste a night with a date nor do you need to feel mean or shallow. If someone can't be honest it's ok to leave. It would only be mean if you called her names. I'm polite with people when I find out they were lying to me in their profiles but I also don't stick around for hours when I don't have to. They're not entitled to my time. ","Guys in general. I've had everything from love letters to being groped by strangers dumped on me by them over my lifetime. I am dreading the warmer weather because for some reason that's when the men behave the worst. I actually limit the hours that I go outside because of poor behavior by men. I am too weird to make \"security friends\" so I am literally out alone when I go out, which makes me a sitting duck, I guess. I don't have anyone RL vent my discontent with the harassment to, either. I also have very bad social anxiety, which doesn't help, even when the guys are nice. It's like a giant wall of dicks builds up, bit by bit with every awkward or inappropriate interaction with guys and then it just comes crashing down in the form of stalking or telling me what I can do with my mouth in public. I cannot wait to \"hit the wall\" as the embittered middle-aged guys in the MGTOW communities say. I am old enough to have had that happen already, but apparently I haven't hit it head on yet. I have tickets to ride the cock carousel, but I don't want to ride it because the idea of it makes me want to vomit, and the carnies of life are not gracious about it. Men should be crate-trained and put up during work hours, IMO. All of you are bad boys who don't get a treat because you just shit everywhere all of the time.\n\nIn other news, I need new shoes. The soles on my favorite pair are dead. I'm more upset about that than my exes trying to strongarm their way back into my life tbh. Life sucks. I can't go out to buy pop after 6PM without the risk of being fatally stabbed by a penis and I have to deal with shoelaces until I go out this weekend to buy more flats. There is no God.","- sex positive: comfortable/open/ethical about sexuality.\n- queer: not (strictly) heterosexual.\n- heteroflexible: heterosexual, but also other things.\n- pan (pansexual): can be attracted by any sex or gender.\n- poly (polyamory): intimate relationship with multiple partners with the knowledge of all partners.\n- casual play and friendship with side of filth: FWB where the F part is important.\n- ENM: Ethical Non-Monogamy\n- Unicorn: the third person in a threesome with a couple.\n\nEven though this description as a whole makes sense and is consistent, it's redundant and poorly written. A more concise version would be something like: sex positive, kinky, pan, FWB or poly, not unicorn.","I was a dick and stood somebody up last week.\n\nShe wanted to go to a bar, but then last minute told me she was bringing her friend and her friend's friend and she didn't want do be 3rd wheeled. Normally I would turn down this kind of meet up, but the bar is walking distance from my house so it was no big deal to pop over for a casual meet-up so I obliged. When I got there I got my drink and didn't see her. I texted to see where she was and she said she had a table in the other room because she invited more people. I circled around into that room and there she was with 8 friends all hella engaged in conversation.\n\nI noped my way back out the room, slammed my drink and left without talking to her.\n\n","&amp;gt; is your dating life a desert?\n\nyes\n\nOKC? Pretty useless after the messaging overhaul. Tinder? Drier than ever. Real life? Much of my (meagre) social life revolves around work, and my industry skews heavily male.\n\nThe underlying issue seems to be that all the smart, stable women my age are in relationships already. (Also that I'm a notoriously picky dater, and enough of a klutz socially to screw things up with most of the ones I *do* like.) Many of my coworkers are my age or ~5 years older, and almost all of them – male and female – are in long-running relationships. I feel like my dating pool is getting smaller and smaller every year.\n\nTen years from now I want to have a steady relationship, maybe a kid on the way. I don't want to be the weird uncle with an unkempt beard, geeky hobbies, and a basement full of bitterness and repression. But I'm really scared of the latter scenario right now.","Just to provide a counterpoint to the sitcom level take here on the male female relationship - I am a guy who actually doesn't like to sleep with a woman in early dates. I am in no way religious or prudish. I don't have a germ thing and I love to touch people.\n\nI just think sex is an expression of intimacy and that takes a little time to develop. I don't need to be ankle deep inside some girl as soon as I meet her. That seems uncomfortable and weird. \n\nI've had some amount of casual sex and it just isn't for me. I get why people like it. I just don't. It frankly makes me feel kind of shallow and empty, and sex with someone too soon feels very similar.\n\nSo to answer the question from my own perspective: You might get lucky if I seem really comfortable, you've indicated that you are at least in this for a few more dates, and I'm giving physical queues that I am interested. And even then if I am being honest, there's a good chance that bringing me home won't lead to sex because I still might not feel ready.\n\nNot saying a lot of guys are like me, but I do insist that there are more than are willing to admit it.","Not to be argumentive, but don't you think it's unfair to build someone up so high in your head, without reallly having a conversation leading towards that build up? \n\nI remember in my younger years I'd do this often with my partners. I'd be excited and eager to make something grow, but never really articulated how I was feeling or what I wanted. Sometimes my partners would be blindsided by my feelings, and would create almost an 'ultimatum'. Eithier you feel the same way I do, or we are over. \n\nAs I've gotten older (currently 30). I've learned to apperciate dating more. Yes, my end goal is a loving, long term relationship, but I enjoy the company I've had, and am having. You had amazing sex. You had an intimate connection with someone. You felt something amazing. Now you know what is possible, now imagine finding that with someone you love and is devoted to you. Maybe this guy wasn't the one, maybe he was the one to help you break the cycle from your ex. Maybe he was meant to just show you what is possible...","Do you feel like you get \"deep\" with the guys?  Or are your conversations all just \"fun\" and hobby and light stuff?  I'm not actually sure what is the \"right\" way to go, so I'm asking more out of curiosity.  One of my theories is that the thing that makes relationships \"go\" is that both people make themselves vulnerable.  I am older, so I think this could be more applicable in the older world.  When younger, people are maybe more into having fun.\n\nI know that as a female, if a guy doesn't get me to open up and then doesn't seem interested and empathetic, that I become uninterested.  I wonder sometimes if it is the same with guys, although it feels like kind of a tightrope because if you ask too much, they sometimes get sort of squirrely.  But if you don't ask enough, maybe they don't feel like they have given enough of themselves to really feel connected.\n\nSo I'm curious, how have you dealt with this in your relationships?  ","I'm a fan of the 5th, 6th and 7th pictures. 7th should go because bathroom selfie. 6th is nice because of the Ed Sheran thing going on but your face is obscured, so I would go for the 5th as a main photo. I like it when people with stuff like lazy eyes don't try to hide it like you do in a couple of them by looking off to the left. Your current first photo is very unflattering, I would ditch it. I like the jesus pose pic, but you need to crop Mr. Derp off the left side of the photo and re-upload it. 2nd to last is a weird angle and dirty room, remove.

Don't use so many of the same posed photo, use like two of those at most, then get 'action' shots. \n\nYour profile is a giant exercise in projection. Confident people don't declare they are confident nor start by projecting that they want to get off this site with their ideal partner. Like dude, read the sidebar already and get out of here with this nonsense.\n\nYour profile is supposed to talk about who/what you are in REALITY. Stick to facts, not dreams. You work in IT and like Salsa dancing... cool now where are your dancing photos? How often do you do it? Don't you have any other hobbies? (video games and movies don't count unless you're into e-sports or art film) What do you do on the weekends/after work?  \n\nFacts and then details about the facts. Tell a story like a reporter would about you, not this cliche 'i'm sad and desperate and want a girl to love me' crap you've got going on here. Nobody wants that!","No let's not, because really all I want to do after reading your post is show evidence why I don't think you're quite right about some things (is that mansplaining? or trashsplaining?) and then talk about some of the serious shit that men disproportionately have to deal with before our short lives fizzle out in a stress induced myocardial infraction.\n\nI don't see a point.  Life sucks, it sucks differently for different people, and some degrees of suck are reserved for men and some for women.  Spreading the suck more evenly might be nice, and lessening it overall would be really great.  Bickering about who has more suck right now is dumb.\n\nNo instead I'd like to point to Grace Hopper who was a genius and a hero, and made huge contributions ranging from the truly fundamental, like building the first compiler to naming computer 'bugs'. \n\nYeah I know Grace Hopper is sort of low hanging fruit for female heroes, but she's related to my field so that's my excuse.","&amp;gt; “Give yourself permission to be turned on by that experience.

Biologically speaking, humans are animals also. Therefore any bodily fluids that may come from a han would violate that practical rule.

I'll write some vague tips that probably apply generally. (source: too many)\n\nHow to behave with them:\n\n- be patient\n- don’t bring it up constantly or in arguments unless it’s actually relevant\n- avoid blunt dismissive language (calm down, get over it, etc.)\n- affection and empathy will probably help more than logic\n- light socialization (isolation is commonly sought but seldom helpful)\n- breaking routine a bit (doesn’t have to be anything big, a walk in a park, getting junk food, etc.)\n- don’t pressure for treatment (there are some obvious exceptions to this) \n\n\nFrom your perspective:\n\n- don't take it personally (this is *way* easier said than done, but it's important to keep reminding yourself)\n- be mindful of your own emotional state (this is mostly relevant if you're living together, you might need to distance yourself for short periods if you find their negativity is dragging you down)\n- it can help to think of the other person like a child in some situations. This might sound odd and condescending, but it's just a trick to help change your perspective. The idea is not to think of them as a literal child, but rather that your instincts for handling a child's emotions are much more appropriate for some situations than your instincts for handling those of an adult. When we interact with children, we tend to be far more empathetic by default because we start on the premise that they cannot manage their emotions so arguing with them about their emotions seems pointless. If an adult has extended periods with severe emotions they cannot manage at all (depression, anger issues, whatever), they are (temporarily) more similar to a child emotionally than an adult.","I got dumped two months ago by the only woman I've ever loved.\n\nI went no contact for two weeks and became best friends with her, and we became closer than anyone I've ever met on this planet.  I still had so many feelings for her.  It didn't help we still had a ton of physical contact.\n\nAfter a few months of hanging out as best friends, I told her how I felt.  She said she had to think about it.\n\nAfter a week of agonizing silence, she called me a week later and told me she can't give me the love I deserve.\n\nIt feels like the breakup part two.\n\nI haven't been able to get over her for two months.  I lose hours of sleep every night thinking about her.  Every single little thing reminds me of her.  I will never meet another woman like her. My world is not a world of abundance, trust my almost 28 years of life on that.\n\nFor all of my 20s, I have sacrificed basically everything I ever cared about to become a better person, spending almost all of my free time trying to make myself a more attractive mate.  Gym seven days a week, more degrees, frugal living to get closer to a $500k net worth, obsessively honing my diet, skincare, wardrobe, and interior design; working on my sense of humor, trying to become more educated and develop opinions on things, being as self-aware and introspective as possible and never getting in an argument or yelling (still at 0 arguments in my lifetime!).  I am really attractive according to anyone I ask and many people have called me \"the most eligible bachelor\" (on the Internet, women I have and haven't dated, people I barely know, people I am close friends with, etc.), and it's because I have spent thousands of hours on that.  I have read every self-help book on the planet, and I am a better person because of it.  I had a good childhood, no issues.  I'm a Straight White Male(TM) over 6 feet tall.  I wear cologne all the time, have a perfect, whitened smile, and consciously spend time each day to dress impeccably.  I don't have any major hurdles in my life besides loneliness.  I spend hours every single day reading up on relationships and how to be a better partner.  I should be hitting them out of the park.\n\nAnd I regret it all.  I would all that effort back in the second if it meant I could have been pursuing something I got something out of.  As my 28th birthday approaches, I wish I could have been born that ugly, short, bald, misogynistic, fat dude that at least has something to look forward to, maybe typical male stuff like video games or sports, or close friends.  At least then I could point to something and say, \"that's why I have never been loved!\"  I've never cared about this and I'm gonna sound like some cringey incel, but I'm starting to feel unsettled that I'll be a 28-year-old virgin in a few days.  It's just that as a well-rounded catch, I don't know what it's like to be desired, wanted, respected by another person, and that means that fundamentally, something is wrong with *who I am.* I've asked every woman I've dated on anything they disliked about me, and they always just \"don't have feelings.\"  Either they're polite cowards or I'm just not meant to be loved. I saw that Mr. Rogers documentary recently, and when they showed the clip of him at a commencement saying \"You don't have to be exceptional to be loved,\" I started crying.  As a grown man. On a plane.  I haven't cried in ages.  Because I do have to be exceptional.  Nothing has proven otherwise.\n\nI just wish for once in my life I was someone's first priority.  Even a friend or a family member.  That for all the giving and energy I put into my relationships with people, I'd get an ounce of it in return (I know that sounds selfish).  I'm just so sick of spending 99% of my time alone.  Meetups don't help.  Hobbies don't help.  People say enjoy being alone, but over the course of my 20s I've done hundreds if not thousands of activities where I live by myself, and I'm sick of it.  \"Oh you did x alone? That's so BRAVE.\" No, dingus, the other option would be staring at the ceiling. I'm sick of being with *me* all the time.  \"Happiness only real if shared\" is the most true statement in the world.  I don't treat women like objects, put them on a pedestal, or view them as anything else other than attractive people I want to have as a companion through life.  And I've gotten nothing but heartbreak out of relationships that I have spent 100x the effort on than them.  Maybe you're not supposed to fall for people so fast, maybe you're not supposed to trust people so easily, maybe you're supposed to play it cool, maybe I shouldn't invest as much, but I don't love that way.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where if I read about someone in love or having sex in a book, it makes me feel that sorrow deep in the pit of my stomach and I cringe, close my eyes, have to skip it, and I'm in a bad mood for the rest of the day.  I know I'm only 27, but still, I just want to know what it's like for someone to want me.  That's the only thing that keeps me grinding to be a better man than I was the day before 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, because maybe if I'm just a little more ripped or a little more educated or a little more funny or a little wealthier, someone will love me.  I just don't see why it has to be this difficult. So that's why I think I'm fooling myself.  There's something about me that is as unattractive as a 99-year-old homeless dude's ballsack. And I get that I'm not entitled to anyone's love.  And I get that I don't deserve love or attention.  But a little scrap for the first time in nearly 10,000 days on this planet would be nice.  (ps don't worry I'm not even slightly pessimistic in real life, just I never get the chance to vent to anyone so I sound like a stupid complainer)\n\nEDIT: Wow this was a wall of text. God I'm such a whiner, I suck.  I swear I'm not this cocky in real life. Welcome to every entry in my journal for the last ten years of my life #singleSince2009","This took way too long to write but I hope you really read this.\n\nI used to be absolutely terrible at interacting with people in general, and even less so with girls and dating. I was in the same boat as you. It took a great deal of concentrated effort and repeated failures over the last 10 years before I became somewhat \"okay\" and much later \"good\" at socializing and dating. Most of the advice is actually pretty solid, but I think you may need help interpreting it.\n\n* Be confident\n\nThere's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem here. You might draw on past success to believe in yourself and act like you're the boss, but if you've never succeeded, how can you be the boss? You fake it. Fake it until you succeed, and then you'll have real experience and successes to draw upon. \n\n* Be yourself\n\nMy personality is quite strong and eccentric. I'm also a huge fucking nerd. This is often too much for first interactions. Cutting down the \"flair\" to 50% and ramping up to 100% over time has worked out much better for me. Not many people like raw durian the first time they try it. Durian ice cream is much more palatable. But the point is, don't pretend to be someone you're not. You should still be you, but you know, maybe you shouldn't talk about your weird hobbies of fetishes on the first date.\n\n* No expectations\n\nI don't think you should have no expectation but you should keep the expectations realistic.\n\nHappiness = Reality - Expectation\n\nThe more you expect, the less happy you'll be.\n\nFor example if you approach a super hot girl, you should expect that you're going to fail 99% of the time (unless you're Ryan Gosling). When you inevitably fail, you shouldn't beat yourself. It was expected. It's okay. But if you really believed you had a good shot, the failure is going to sting.\n\nYou should reflect on your failures. See what you did and how to improve. Then you get back on your feet and try again. It's very easy to be discouraged. I struggle with this all the time.\n\n* Misogynistic bullshit\n\nI interpret this as, \"don't be that stereotypical nice guy.\" Don't be an asshole either. Avoid being overly appeasing and accommodating. It can seem like you have no backbone or that you're too desperate or thirsty. These aren't exactly attractive characteristics. Yeah, don't be misogynistic. \n\n* Try seeing women as people\n\nThis kind of goes along with the previous point. The more I like a girl, the more I'm likely to put her on a pedestal. It's difficult. When you prostrate yourself and worship the very ground she walks on, you run the risk being stepped on. Most people don't want to date beneath them so don't put yourself down there by being overly appeasing and accommodating. Have some backbone.\n\n* \"Just say hi\"/just talk to them/just put yourself out there\n\n&amp;gt;One time I was at a bar and I walked over to a woman and said hi.\n\nI've approached hundreds of women I can tell you the opening isn't important. You can say almost anything with little effect on the outcome (pickup lines might have a very small up or down tick here). What's important is how you carry the conversation/interaction afterwards. That means you can't say \"hi,\" stare for a bit, and shyly run away. The other point here is that saying \"hi\" is 100x better than just sitting in the corner and staring at them.\n\n* Just go out and have a good time and it'll happen\n\nYes, being introverted means you might avoid social activities or events. You miss 100% of the shots you didn't make because you weren't even on the court. You don't have to go out to bars and nightclubs to meet people. You should find activities or hobbies that you enjoy and find ways to meet people through that. For example you can meet people at the climbing gym, tennis club, hiking adventures, book club, anime/gaming events, etc. \n\nBut you shouldn't do these things just to find a girlfriend. Do them because you actually like the activity or club. Meeting a potential date is an added bonus.\n\n* You can actually do it, but you just don't know that you know\n\nYes, you can, but you'll need a shitton of practice first. And that means failing repeatedly. There's no easy way around this.\n\n* Have a life\n\nSame as above-- how can these passions/hobbies put you in situations where you meet people?\n\n* Stop wanting it\n\nI think most people can sense desperation/thirst. It's a turn off. Try acting like you're not thirsty even if you're as parched as a mother fucker.\n\n&amp;gt;I fucking hate when I ask people how they get laid/get dates and their immediate reply is laughing, followed by asking me if I'm serious, followed by more laughing about how absurd my question is because it must be obvious to everyone in the world but me. It happens so often I try not to ask.\n\nIf this is usually what happens, you're probably doing something wrong. Try to look back and figure it out. Was it a relevant question with respect to the previous conversation? Is this a wildly inappropriate setting? Do you know this person well enough to have a candid conversation about having sex? \n\n","&amp;gt; SHOW INTEREST. It seems like a no-brainer, but apparently that’s not the case. It’s insane how few guys even initiate conversation or try at all in the beginning. It’s like they figure there’s always something better around the corner, so whatever. Either pursue me and make your intentions clear or get away from me.\n\nI don't want to say anything unless I feel you'll react positively to it, plus I don't automatically assume that women being nice to me are into me, so I keep my mouth shut for fear of looking like an idiot. And the whole \"chase me\" thing is a stupid game you can't win. Stop chasing someone, \"you're boring and not willing to fight for what you want, go away!\" Keep chasing someone, \"no means no, asshole, this is harassment, go away!\" I will agree with you on making your intentions clear from the start - hanging around someone and hoping they'll read your mind and feel the same way is a recipe for disaster - but it works both ways.\n\n&amp;gt; TALK TO ME. Have an actual, legitimate conversation with me. Get to know me. Make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. Don’t send me two texts and then ghost. I don’t want to waste another minute of my time on something that’s going absolutely nowhere. Either act interested or don’t bother in the first place.\n\nI don't want to waste my time either. I don't want to invest in anyone unless I feel like it'll actually go somewhere. I can ask you the deepest philosophical questions there are, but if all you give me are curt, one-word answers then I assume you're not interested.\n\n&amp;gt; CALL ME. No one calls anyone anymore, and it drives me insane. If you’re trying to ask someone out, you should call that person. End of story. I don’t want to be asked out over text, or even worse, online. That means you didn’t even make the effort to get my phone number.\n\n I can't read your mind to figure out how *you* want to be asked out. Plus times have changed, this is the era of texting and apps, maybe you should lower your standards and join the rest of us in the 21st century.\n\n&amp;gt; ASK ME OUT. For real. Over the phone. On a date. Don’t ask me to hang out, or chill, or whatever people are saying these days. I’m not that girl. I want someone who appreciates me as a person and wants to take me on a real date. If you’re too lazy to do so, then lose my number. I don’t need you to take me somewhere fancy, but at least put some thought into it.\n\nSee previous.\n\n&amp;gt; SHUT UP ABOUT YOURSELF. You finally get to a first date, and he spends the entire time jabbering away about his own life and problems. I didn’t sign up to be your therapist, dude. Reality check: this doesn’t show how open and vulnerable you are. It shows how narcissistic, self-absorbed, and insecure you are. I want to get to know you, obviously, but we’re never going to work out if you don’t spend some time listening to me, too.\n\nYou want me to, as per point 2, have an actual, legitimate conversation with you, get to know you, make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. So you want me to ask all about you, but you don't want to ask at all about me? A conversation takes two people, lady, and you're presumably trying to find out about me just as much as I'm trying to find out about you. Maybe you should shut up for a while and learn about me. Just because I reveal things about myself doesn't mean I think you're my therapist.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW SOME RESPECT. I am a strong and independent woman. I don’t want a guy to be intimidated by me. I do want a man to respect me as an equal and treat me as such. My independence definitely doesn’t mean you get to abandon your manners and courtesy. I want someone who still opens doors, pulls out chairs, and gets up on the subway to give an older person his seat. No respect, no date.\n\nYou're \"strong\" and \"independent\" and \"want a man to respect me as an equal\", but you still want me to open doors for you, pull out your chair for you, etc? So you want me to treat you like a dainty flower that can't do anything for herself. Or you want me to treat you like royalty. That's not equality either way, that's treating you with exceptionalism. I'd respect you more if you could at least admit that.\n\n&amp;gt; THINK OF INTERESTING DATES. If you’ve actually talked to me and taken some time to get to know what I like, you can do better than the overdone \"dinner and a movie\" date. If you haven’t, I don’t want to go out with you anyway. When I plan our dates, I’m going to be creative, and I expect the same from you.\n\nI'm sure there are better date ideas than dinner and a movie, but I also don't want to date someone that expects to be impressed with something novel each time. All I'm hearing from this point is \"entertain me\". And you talk about when you plan dates, but I've got a feeling that you actually expect *me* to do all the planning and setting up the arrangements. This makes you sound very high maintenance, and I personally am not into that.\n\n&amp;gt; COMPLIMENT ME. Strong, independent women still want to be complimented. Every woman likes hearing that she’s pretty, funny, intelligent, and wonderful. This problem baffles me more than anything else. It’s so easy to pay a compliment, and yet most men simply don’t bother. WTF?\n\nI have no objections to this one.\n\n&amp;gt; TREAT ME WELL. I will treat you well, but I want to know that you’ll do the same as well. I’ve been in too many situations where I was a great girlfriend to a terrible boyfriend. I’m wary of going there again, so sorry — you’re going to have to prove yourself.\n\nI question how \"great\" a girlfriend you were and how \"terrible\" your boyfriends were given how narcissistic you sound so far, but it's a common enough feeling that I'll take your word for it. It boils down to the conundrum with dating in general - neither of us wants to invest in the other until we're sure the other won't disappoint us. I expect you to prove yourself to me just as much as you expect me to prove myself to you. At some point we're going to have to trust each other, otherwise one of us is moving on.\n\n&amp;gt; CONSIDER MY FEELINGS. Yes, this is a component of a mature relationship. You have to think about someone besides yourself. You can’t just make whatever decision you want without thinking about whether it might hurt me. This means you need to tell me if you’re seeing other people, and you can’t just spout insensitive crap out of your mouth. All I ask is that you’re a considerate human being.\n\nAre you going to consider my feelings in return? And if I accidentally say something you perceive as insensitive, are you going to let me know so that I can learn not to say it again? Or are you going to go cold on me and not communicate with me?\n\n&amp;gt; UNDERSTAND THAT I’M WORTH IT. I can’t date any more men who don’t put in any effort. I know that I’m worthy of a great guy, and it drives me crazy that so many jerks don’t see it. Obviously they aren’t the right men for me, but I’m so tired of waiting around for one who is. When is someone going to man up and decide he wants me for his own?\n\nSo far you seem to define \"effort\" as \"someone who will show their entire hand to me without seeing any of my cards\". You want a guy to pursue you, treat you like a queen, and act completely invested in you, all without any show of promise that you'll do likewise for them. Maybe you keep dating men who don't appear to put in any effort because you're not putting in any effort? It's a two-way street, lady.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW ME YOU CARE. I’m pretty chill, but don’t treat me like one of your bros. Make at least little gestures to show that you’re interested and that you appreciate me as a person. It can be as small as a sweet, lingering kiss or brushing my hair away from my face. Just some little way of showing you care is always appreciated.\n\nEveryone expresses their love and affection in different ways. Either learn to recognize someone's style, or just ask them for the type of affection that you want. And why would I give someone I just met a lingering kiss or brush their hair away? That's getting too far into someone's personal space too soon. It takes time to build that sort of affection and trust.\n\n&amp;gt; TRY YOUR BEST. I’m not asking for perfection here. Just make a little effort, and I’ll be happy. What drives me insane are all the guys who simply don’t try at all. It’s extremely upsetting and frustrating. I’m starting to feel like it’s me, but I refuse to lower my standards just because men don’t seem to be capable of meeting them.\n\nI somehow doubt you're not looking for perfection, or that you'd actually be satisfied with someone putting in a \"little\" effort. But at least you've got some self-awareness.\n\n&amp;gt; CHALLENGE ME. Talk to me. Ask me deep questions. Find out what makes me tick. I want to connect on a deeper level, and I want someone who is all about doing that, too. Help make me want to be the best I can be every single day. There’s no point for me to bring another person into my life unless we’re going to benefit each other.\n\nThis is just a rehash of a few of the above points and requires no further rebuttal.\n\n&amp;gt; CONNECT WITH ME. I’m not looking for some surface BS, so if that’s all you want, let me know upfront. Don’t try to trick me into thinking you want more so you can get laid. I’m so done with that sneaky, dishonest behavior. Either put effort into what we have, or don’t even bother starting anything with me.\n\nSee previous.\n\nMost of this can be condensed into \"I don't want to invest in someone unless they've invested in me\". Fair enough, I'm sure it's a universal condition, but the entire thing as worded comes off as entitled. The only line it was missing was \"are there any good men out there still?\"\n\ntldr; I put way too much effort into this.","After a couple of weeks of messaging, I met this guy from another town. I waited for him for like 25min, during which he was messaging me like he has no idea where we're supposed to meet (he chose the spot and he's been there a million times). Finally he shows up from a totally nonsensical direction and when I asked why the hell did he go there he said 'Oh I was just curious why not' (?? from what I've later learned he probably just stood somewhere watching me wait for him).\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay whatever, we go to a nice popular bar with a garden and we spend 1h talking about topics he chose which were really random, like I'm a zero sex interest. No chemistry between us. But at least it's not unpleasant, until he just asks 'You wanna go for a walk?'. Okay fine, I get it, you're bored so we go and walk for 2 hours.  I would've said No if he didn't have to drive for 90min to get there so I play along. I get really frustrated and tired and decide to call it a day. He didn't even want to kiss my cheek when saying good bye so I figure 'Well at least it makes sense, he was disappointed sexually, we hung a bit and that's it'.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nA week passed and he gets all curious why I'm not messaging him anymore, so I explain how it's fine that he's not into me, at least we had a nice talk and a walk. Then he goes crazy calling me a silly bitch, wasn't it obvious how much he liked me, he might be in love, how I should have been satisfied with the fact he just wanted to look at me (he didn't look at me when we walked, so why push the idea of walk), why does everything have to be so physical etc.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, in the weeks that followed I found out he's got a sweet mix of Oedipus, Borderline and Peter Pan, he's totally gay but chases women and he never really had sex. Poor thing. I offered to lend a helping ear but he sent me a 30 A4 page long essay how I should change my personality or I'll die alone.\n\nYou can't make this stuff up...","Three years later, I still don’t know why I did this, but I ‘ghosted’ on a girl I loved and cared for, that I had been seeing for many years.\n\nI worked away and she sent me a message and I just didn’t reply. I kept ignoring her messages, ‘why are you ignoring me, what have I done?’ Her messages got more pleading and desperate.\nA week later she said she was going out with friends as she was so down, and then I finally got sense and contacted her.\n\nHer next message was along the lines of her developing feelings for a friend and maybe this was a sign our relationship was over and we should just start new lives. She said we should still keep in touch, but I never spoke to or saw her again after that.\n\nI remember reading that message and I felt like the Hindenburg. What an completely idiotic and senseless thing to do and I 100% fully deserved that and the downvotes.","do what you can\n\nFirst fix your shit. \n\n1. Do you have acne?

Upgrade your warddrobe, you don't need to spend a lot of money, but buying new clothes that actually fit and look good can help you get a lot of confidence \n\nNext, psych yourself up:\n\n1. You need to understand that if you think its bad for you, its a 100x worse for the woman. You need to realize that its a MASSIVE hit to a woman's self esteem to be on a dating site. Resorting to using dating sites is a massive admission of failure in attracting a man via traditional means. Thats why pretty much every girl will have \"my friends made me do it\" or \"I can't believe I'm doing this\" or \"if anyone asks, we'll say we met at whole foods\". They are downright ashamed of it. So if you ever feel bad, realize that she has it a LOOOT worse than you\n2. Next you need to realize, that no matter how \"good\" the profiles look, most of it is bullshit. People lie on dating sites more than they do on Facebook and Instagram. A bank teller will say they work in finance. That \"CEO\" is a guy who setup a squarespace website, with \"Send me $1 to 123 Fake Street\" plastered all over it. That \"model\" probably had 1 paying gig this month, and made a whopping $300. Those happy, interesting photos, were probably taken over the course of the last 15 years, and were staged to be more interesting than the vacation was. And that intimidating profile, is mostly bullshit. Noone's life is as interesting, as how they portray it on their dating profiles. The girl who says that she likes to spend every evening sitting on couch, sipping some wine, while reading the latest philosophical text, most likely just did that once in the past month, and the wine came in a box, the book was a copy of Cosmo and sitting on the couch was her sitting on the floor crying about the fact that she is still single. The guy who talks about living life and taking advantage of everything that life has to offer, most likely spends most of his free time playing video games while working some shit job. \n3. So once you realize everyone else is full of shit, you can stop being so intimidated by others. ","V. young.  Get older.

I am not a big fan of texting. Yet, sure, if somebody seemingly interesting (I'll address \"seemingly\" in the next paragraph) reaches out, sometimes I'll eagerly get into a quick back and forth. But I ain't going to sustain that pace. Sooner or later I expect to see somebody writing about me on here - the endless hand wringing, 'does he like me', on and on. You are using a proxy (texting) to measure something else (do I like you). Everyone will reply how I must have another woman lined up, you are my back up option, and on and on. Yet the reality is my interest in texting is not at all correlated with my liking a person. \n\n\"Seemingly\". You are just words on a screen to me. All the hand wringing about 'does s/he like me' when you haven't even met, or just met for drinks! I think a stable, mentally healthy person is not going to put a lot of weight on a chat on a dating app, even if it is going well. Face it - almost every single one fails. If you are currently single, every last relationship you've ever been in failed, for that matter. I don't \"like\" you now, I don't know you. I don't know you after 2-3 dates. At most you might have piqued my interest. I've had people in my life for a long time (platonic friends) before I realized it could be more. I've dated for a few months before learning this is a bad match. It takes time. But no, we have to analyze texting patterns and frequencies, every random comment, anything to assuage that gaping hole of need in our hearts. You don't know each other. Conversation flowing on the second date doesn't equal the ability and desire to build a life together which shared goals and mores. Relax! \n\nIn short, I'm a fan of attachment theory. Maybe not every aspect, but certainly the broad contours. Much of the advice on here is not coming from a secure attachment style. Some is, of course. I've noticed some people giving consistent advice coming from this viewpoint.\n\nSpeaking for myself, having gone through a long term relationship w/o a stable attachment in my partner it is now nearly a trigger point, so I'm aware I'm overstating things a bit above. But also, know this. You can't hid it. All the sadness and hand wringing comes through, not on the electrons, but the silences, the \"just joking but really serious lol\" questions - all the \"if he was really into you\" behaviors. And I run. Because it is toxic. That's unfair, because I think there is the possibility of changing styles, and early behavior can be a bit neurotic without it permeating a LTR. But, to be honest, each time I ignore it I end up getting a 4am hostile rant on how I didn't reply fast enough, or an accusation of being on a 'hunt' because my ad is still up, or a 'forget about it' because I haven't asked her out after a few emails (these examples are from the last 2 months, I've been trying to not end communications so rapidly despite misgivings). \n\nNone of this is meant to excuse boorish behavior. It is safe to conclude that a stranger who sends a dick pic doesn't consider you a nuanced being with whom they wish to discuss epistemology, ethics, and child rearing. \n\nTL;DR: 8 paragraph OP reporting every text, every throwaway phrase, every joke - stop! And responders - you can't read tea leaves. Stop! You are getting nowhere, and making yourselves anxious and unhappy, and I (nearly) guarantee the person on the other end can sense it.\n\n\nedit: so much for TL;DR. That last paragraph brings up a related point. You get what you ask for. Not in a mystical, the universe answers your prayers sense. In the pragmatic sense. So much advice to women is based on passivity and \"if he liked you...\". What's the result? Your filters reject people with a full life, with a stable attachment style, people who have a nuanced view of early dating. And it accepts people that go 'all in' after 3 texts - falling in love with an idea, not a person. The advice leans heavily on \"butterfly's\" and \"chemistry\". Also known as Oxytocin. We understand the biochemistry of love and attachment. Oxytocin fades. Sometimes it doesn't really get super strong with some people. It is NOT a predictor of long term compatibility or committed love. We have the science to back that up. Yet most of the advice on here focuses on that. \n\nWe all feel oxytocin. It's a great feeling! But I think the mature approach is to discount it - to be wary of it misleading us into something ill suited for us. For all my verbiage I do the same things - get caught up in an idea of a person, feel flustered, feel neurotic(does she like me!!?!?!) all that stuff, good and bad. We are bags of chemicals, after all, molded by millions of years of evolution to procreate. But now we want something a bit different than our biological imperatives. We are conscious, and can choose different behaviors. Choose somebody that throws themselves into you after 2 dates, well, know that oxytocin fades, and in 6 months they'll be \"just not that into you\". ","It sounds cheesy and kind of like a humble brag even though I don't mean it that way, but in almost every way. I'm blessed with a super well paying job and a beautiful apartment in a ridiculous city with my adorable dog. I have family and friends who love me as deeply as I loved them, generally good health, and I've been loved by a partner once, maybe twice in my life. I've traveled the world and read so many books and watched the crappiest movies. I'm just incredibly blessed and I'm super thankful for it every day and try to remember it every time I get down about being alone or knowing I'm not on the same track as everyone else who is shacking up. ","Guys in general. I've had everything from love letters to being groped by strangers dumped on me by them over my lifetime. I am dreading the warmer weather because for some reason that's when the men behave the worst. I actually limit the hours that I go outside because of poor behavior by men. I am too weird to make \"security friends\" so I am literally out alone when I go out, which makes me a sitting duck, I guess. I don't have anyone RL vent my discontent with the harassment to, either. I also have very bad social anxiety, which doesn't help, even when the guys are nice. It's like a giant wall of dicks builds up, bit by bit with every awkward or inappropriate interaction with guys and then it just comes crashing down in the form of stalking or telling me what I can do with my mouth in public. I cannot wait to \"hit the wall\" as the embittered middle-aged guys in the MGTOW communities say. I am old enough to have had that happen already, but apparently I haven't hit it head on yet. I have tickets to ride the cock carousel, but I don't want to ride it because the idea of it makes me want to vomit, and the carnies of life are not gracious about it. Men should be crate-trained and put up during work hours, IMO. All of you are bad boys who don't get a treat because you just shit everywhere all of the time.\n\nIn other news, I need new shoes.

There is no God.","Life in this society being, at best, an utter bore and no aspect of society being at all relevant to women, there remains to civic-minded, responsible, thrill-seeking females only to overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and destroy the male sex.\nIt is now technically feasible to reproduce without the aid of males (or, for that matter, females) and to produce only females. We must begin immediately to do so. Retaining the male has not even the dubious purpose of reproduction. The male is a biological accident: the Y (male) gene is an incomplete X (female) gene, that is, it has an incomplete set of chromosomes. In other words, the male is an incomplete female, a walking abortion, aborted at the gene stage. To be male is to be deficient, emotionally limited; maleness is a deficiency disease and males are emotional cripples.\nThe male is completely egocentric, trapped inside himself, incapable of empathizing or identifying with others, or love, friendship, affection of tenderness. He is a completely isolated unit, incapable of rapport with anyone. His responses are entirely visceral, not cerebral; his intelligence is a mere tool in the services of his drives and needs; he is incapable of mental passion, mental interaction; he can't relate to anything other than his own physical sensations. He is a half-dead, unresponsive lump, incapable of giving or receiving pleasure or happiness; consequently, he is at best an utter bore, an inoffensive blob, since only those capable of absorption in others can be charming. He is trapped in a twilight zone halfway between humans and apes, and is far worse off than the apes because, unlike the apes, he is capable of a large array of negative feelings -- hate, jealousy, contempt, disgust, guilt, shame, doubt -- and moreover, he is aware of what he is and what he isn't.\nAlthough completely physical, the male is unfit even for stud service. Even assuming mechanical proficiency, which few men have, he is, first of all, incapable of zestfully, lustfully, tearing off a piece, but instead is eaten up with guilt, shame, fear and insecurity, feelings rooted in male nature, which the most enlightened training can only minimize; second, the physical feeling he attains is next to nothing; and third, he is not empathizing with his partner, but is obsessed with how he's doing, turning in an A performance, doing a good plumbing job. To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he's a machine, a walking dildo. It's often said that men use women. Use them for what? Surely not pleasure.","&amp;gt; [Serious] How does one find love when they have no equality in their career, are not compulsive dick suckers, and won't completely fall for anybody who will offer them free dinner for sex, and only gets replies from trolls and armchair activits.\n\nRofl. Not literally, but almost.\n\n&amp;gt; Instead this group hosts events for the women here to \"Learn how to play video games\".\n\nThat is like downright sexist and pointless, isn't it?\n\nI haven't witnessed any gender based inequalities at my work place so far, so that's good I suppose.\n\n&amp;gt; serious stuff\n\nBelow are the broad strokes disadvantages of males and females that I perceive from my vantage point (Canada). It's implied that these lists are comparing the genders to each other, because I don't have a base case to compare them to. For example, I included \"more judged on physical appearance\" on the female list but not the male list because even though both genders have to deal with this significantly, in my opinion women do so more.\n\nFemales\n\n- more judged on relationship status\n- more judged on sexual preferences/activity\n- more susceptible to sexual violence\n- more susceptible to harassement\n- more judged on physical appearance\n- more career and salary obstacles\n- taken less seriously intellectually\n- more negative judgement for assertive behavior\n\nMales\n\n- more expectation to pay for things and take initiative\n- more expectation towards sexual performance\n- more judged for expressing emotion\n- more judged on career choice\n- more judged on choice of hobbies and interests\n- more judged on career advancement and aptitude\n\nConclusion: society's come a long way in a short period of time (women couldn't vote like 100 years ago), and hopefully the trend continues. Even though both genders face different challenges and stereotypes, in my opinion it still remains more difficult to be a woman even in well developed countries and without considering biological disadvantages like muscular strength, periods and pregnancy.\n\nAnd of course, if your sexual orientation and gender identity is more complicated than hetero male/female or you don't live in one of the more accepting countries, things can get absurdly unfair and terrible.\n","Guys this article covers more than just angry male incels. \n\n&amp;gt;The question, then, is how to dwell in the ambivalent place where we acknowledge that no one is obligated to desire anyone else, that no one has a right to be desired, but also that who is desired and who isn’t is a political question, a question usually answered by more general patterns of domination and exclusion.\n\n\n\n&amp;gt;To take this question seriously requires that we recognise that the very idea of fixed sexual preference is political, not metaphysical. As a matter of good politics, we treat the preferences of others as sacred: we are rightly wary of speaking of what people really want, or what some idealised version of them would want. That way, we know, authoritarianism lies. This is true, most of all, in sex, .... But the fact is that our sexual preferences can and do alter, sometimes under the operation of our own wills – not automatically, but not impossibly either. What’s more, sexual desire doesn’t always neatly conform to our own sense of it, .... Desire can take us by surprise, leading us somewhere we hadn’t imagined we would ever go, or towards someone we never thought we would lust after, or love. In the very best cases, the cases that perhaps ground our best hope, desire can cut against what politics has chosen for us, and choose for itself.\n\n\nShe argues that sexual desire and preferences reflect social/political power structures (group trends about what is attractive is tied to what society/that group deems as normal/ideal) and is exclusionary to outliers. That it isn't a neutral thing that you develop in a vacuum (which is something I see alot of people argue). She also argues that this isn't always the case at the individual level.\n\n\n\nI think she raises a point that people debate about alot. The author uses the lens of the exclusion of minority people, trans women, overweight people, but it's applicable to discussions people have on here regarding the impact of male height, male earning potential, etc on dating.  I don't see any arguments in the article that tells the reader to abandon their preferences, but this is supposed to be philosophical and not preachy.\n\nI think I agree with dating preferences are a reflection of power structures. Idk. What are your thoughts?","Everyone in here having fits about \"le females only pursue the top 20% of men!!! most men have no chance to mate ever!!!\" like listen bitchezzz the US department of statistics says that the number of sex partners, in heterosexual persons between the ages of 15 and 40, is VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL BETWEEN THE SEXES both in annual and in lifetime incidences. Straight men and women in the us are gettin laid at THE SAME RATE. There is *no* tiny minority of men getting all the women and *no* vast sea of completely unsuccessful men who can't get a single date because all the women are angling for the same few dudes. That isnt happening. For every woman who gets some, there is an equal and opposite man who gets some, and no, there is no gender imbalance in the numbers there. \n\nEdit: autocorrect changed minority to majority for some reason","This article is so wack. \n\n&amp;gt;What’s more annoying is when men call me out for my sorries, whether in the workplace (“What are you apologizing for?”) or in bed (“You don’t ever have to apologize to me”). It’s like telling someone with asthma not to cough.\n\nWhen women are overly apologetic to me, I let them know they don't have to be sorry as reassurance that they haven't done anything wrong. I wouldn't even call that \"calling it out\". Also, over time, the apologies start to make me feel slightly uncomfortable because in my mind she thinks I'm someone that's going to harshly reprimand her for every perceived wrong-doing she does, which isn't me at all. \n\n&amp;gt;  It’s condescending in the same way it was condescending when my college boyfriend, riding the high of a women’s studies class he’d taken five years prior, interrupted me mid-sentence to tell me that what I was saying was “not in line with third-wave feminism.”\n\nThat's a reach.\n\n&amp;gt; No man—not even one who completed three months of women’s studies—is qualified to comment on a woman’s habits or language.\n\nYikes dawg.\n\nWhat's even worse is that the author isn't attempting to curb her bad habits in this article or improve them. Instead she just wants people to not mention it and wants to continue to act however she wants without anyone giving a comment about it.","&amp;gt;The concept of **toxic masculinity** is used in [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) and [gender studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_studies) to refer to certain norms of [masculine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculine) behavior in North America and Europe that are associated with harm to society and to [men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men) themselves. Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as [misogyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny) and [homophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia), can be considered \"toxic\" due to their promotion of violence, including [sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault) and [domestic violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence).

And this master narrative, inevitably, makes both the new inequalities and the decline of actual relationships that much more difficult to bear …\n\nI found this paragraph interesting because I don't believe this is equally true for each gender. I agree with him that we should continue to listen to the intellectual fringes on each side with open minds, but there is a personal sovereignty and consent issue with sex in general.","&amp;gt;When I try to have sex, I get shut down\n\nYou've only been dating for a few weeks? Have you kept trying to initiate PIV? It shouldn't really be getting to the stage of \"shutting down\" any more as all her signals you've shared here seem to be saying \"Not ready.\"\n\n&amp;gt;How to even discuss this because she won't tell me yet\n\n\nIn general (assuming this is based on past trauma and not just someone who wants to take it slow), I'd suggest:\n\n1. Instead of prying into \"what happened\" in the past, see if she's open to talking about what she needs in the present. How can you help her feel safe? Would she prefer to be the one to escalate physically? Are there particular kinds of non-PIV physical contact that make her uncomfortable?\n\n2. When talking about your feelings, refrain from making definitive timelines and presenting things in a way that pressures her. Let her know with your words and actions that you are a person who will respect boundaries and listen to her verbal and nonverbal cues. \n\n2. Being careful not to focus entirely on physical intimacy. Building emotional intimacy and creating trust can be really important. \n\n&amp;gt;How long I can wait\n\nThat above being said, it's also okay if you decide that this is not a situation that you're able or willing to cope with.

HB and I went to see JW:FK a couple weeks ago and the movie was trash and just made us sad. Ended up going to a bar after to drink away our sorrows together and had an amazing time. Talking with him is just nice and easy. So, we stay at the bar until close and then head out and are lingering on the sidewalk, and pretty much all I'm thinking is that I really hope he'll kiss me, and then... we end up getting robbed at gunpoint. I don't have much to say about it, we're both pretty shaken up and traumatized and probably not as okay as we keep saying we are, but we're physically fine. We've been checking in on each other a lot, I end up leaving for vacation a few days later but we text every day, just checking in on how we're doing but also joking a lot about other things.\n\nI get back from vacation and we go out again a couple days after that. I was kind of nervous to see him because it's the first time since ~the incident~ but everything was just as great as it was before. But at the end of the night we were leaving and we were alone in the parking lot and he just held me and kissed the top of my head and I told him that I like him a little bit, and he agreed, and we walked over to my car and stood there, and he said that he was stupid to be lingering in the dark at 2am with me just like we were last time, but I'm so engaging that's it's hard not to. We admit that we're both unusually comfortable with each other and that it's weird but we kind of like it. And then we held each other some more and I looked up at him, and he kissed my forehead, and I'm pretty sure I sighed very dramatically and then he actually kissed me. And he said he wants to go hiking with me and watch the original JP with me. And I love that he always tells me to let him know that I get home safely. So I have a ^^^big crush on him but am trying very hard to stay grounded. That is all.","Hot Bassist and I talked about potentially going to a baseball game on Thursday and when I texted him about it that afternoon he told me he forgot he was going to a show with his friend that night, but ended it in a way that made me unsure if he was inviting me to join in or not. We awkwardly danced around the subject for a couple hours before I had to say \"I can't tell if you're inviting me or not\" and then he said yes, so then I spent a lot of time overthinking whether or not I'd be third wheeling. More time passes, he ends up telling me he's won an extra ticket through the venue and would love for me to come if I was still thinking about it so I go and have an amazing time. \n\nHis friend came up to us once during the show and then walked off so it was just the two of us pretty much the entire time. After the show we stayed at the bar until they closed and then he walked me to my car. We talked for a little bit there and then this group came up right next to us and we got kind of quiet, so he ended up taking me up on my offer to drive him over to his car but when we got in we just ended up listening to music and talking for 3 hours. It kept getting later and later and we'd be like \"oh god we really need to go\" but then we wouldn't. We also talked about how it's inevitable that we see the new Jurassic World together when it comes out but that's 2 weeks away! So much could go wrong! Anyway, he is cute and funny and smart and the good kind of weird and I am very much crushing. Also I really love when people tell me to drive safe and let them know when I make it home? Also I have never felt so comfortable and warm when someone has hugged me ^^^please ^^^send ^^^help","I've been talking to a Hot Bassist on Bumble for about a week and decided to ask him out so we did that Wednesday. Went to a brewery and got a couple beers and talked. He is....very, *very* cute in person, sweet and a little introverted, and we have a lot of things in common like our love for Jurassic Park and a gigantic crush on Jeff Goldblum, music taste, both love to read, etc. I asked him a bunch of invasive questions about his family and life in general and we were both really open and honest about our fears and shortcomings and it was just really...nice? \n\nAt the end he walked me to my car and said he wanted to do it again (and I, a big dummy, said 'really?! are you sure?' because dating has just been such a dumpster fire for the past 8 months and I feel so terrible at reading people now) and he laughed and said yes and that I'm cute and funny and ~deep~ and we exchanged numbers and hugged and we've been texting a good amount since, so I'm hopeful but also trying to be realistic about things. I'm hoping he asks me but if he doesn't I'll probably see if he wants to do something mid-week so at least I'll have my answer if we'll see each other again or not. ","1st of the year I met up with a real sweet, really cute girl who seemed pretty into me- texting me a bunch, got kinda buzzed one night and said she thought I was really cute and was really excited to meet me.  Got to the bar we agreed on, sat there for ~4 hours just talking about whatever, enjoying each others company until it closed up.  I was sick so I didn't kiss her at the end even though I'm pretty sure we both wanted to, but she hopped up and kissed my cheek before getting in her car and it was very adorable.  Had a lil day trip date thing planned after that going down to another city to do some museums and restaurants, but had to cancel because fucking northeast snow can suck my dong and she didn't wanna drive in it. Rescheduled for a movie date later, which was still pretty nice.  Ended well I thought, she told me a bunch of stuff from her favorite books she wanted to show me and joked about and etc.  while we were just hanging around the lobby talking about whatever since neither of us seemed to want to leave.  So I was felling really optimistic about maybe something coming out of all this. \n\nThen three days later she started talking less and eventually ghosted me for one reason or another, which sucked, because I let myself get invested. (a little early, so my fault I guess).\n\nWent on another date with a girl who was very nice but had no chemistry with.  Been dead in the water since then. \n\nAnd you thought you would get a happy ending out of any of this didn't you?  Got ya! \n\ntl;dr fuck 2018 see ya'll 2019","Haven't posted in here in a while because the most interesting about my romantic life over the past year of my life has been its consistent mediocrity.\n\nDespite how much I travel I've never had any travel romances, but that finally changed last week!\n\nI just got back from a long vacation that included a 10-day trekking section. There were a bunch of cool people that were part of it, but one person in particular stood out (and she happened to be the first one that I met at the start). Though we got along well from the start, it was quite platonic. But over the course of the 10-days of trekking we got more into each other and spend more time talking and getting to know one another, and I grew especially fond of her infectious laugh, intelligence, and great sense of humor.\n\nA 120km trekking trip is an interesting place to develop a romantic connection because you're not exactly looking (or smelling) your best, so the connection is based a lot more on compatibility type things. At the end of the trip we got back to (sorta) civilization in a town of 6,000 that is one of the largest in the eastern part of the country. After cold showers (there was a power cut, so no hot water) we went out clubbing with the rest of the team and ended up doing lots of cuddling and making out. And once we got back to the hotel we ended up making out in the hallway for a while before hooking up quietly in the bathroom of her room while her roommate slept.\n\nAnd then the next night (the last night of the trip) we stayed up very late talking again, and she ultimately slept in my bed with me, which hasn't happened in a really long time.\n\nI last saw her riding the escalator up to customs in Kathmandu, and it made me sad that I'll almost certainly never see her again because she lives on the other side of the world and tends to work in war-torn countries. We both travel a lot so it's possible, but I'm trying to just be happy that it happened and not look for an unrealistic future.\n\nIt has made me reconsider relationships a bit, in hopes of giving people more of a chance for that connection to develop, because it developed really really strongly in this case and made the return to home from this trip harder than any other before it.","I can keep it light before the first date, but after the first date, I'm not gonna hold back and I'll text them as much as I feel like is right. Flat out, I feel more comfortable and first dates go better for me when there's a decent amount of texting beforehand. I'm a pretty frequent texter, so I'll probably annoy the piss out of someone who doesn't want to text a decent amount and I'm comfortable with that. And I get kind of annoyed/bored with people who suck at texting. I like to keep conversation going between seeing each other. It's honestly almost better to get that out of the way early and know what we can each expect. \n\nLike I said, before the first date? I'll mirror their texting patterns/frequency for the most part because neither of us has any clue how things will go. If she's pretty responsive, I'll just text her as much as I feel like. If she's not responsive, I won't text her for a couple days to see if she texts me of her own volition, rather than forcing a conversation. If she feels no need to talk to me between dates, I'll also know we're not a good fit.\n\nOP, I think you're totally fair to be a bit reserved about texting because guys can definitely get overeager and overinvested before a first date. The way I'd try to frame it is that right or wrong, they're coming on too strong because they don't get a ton of opportunities. From stories like this, you can tell pretty easily these type of guys don't go on dates very often. It comes off as desperate and unattractive, and is largely why I hold off on texting a ton before first dates. Once a girl has met me, she can see that there's nothing weird about me and it'll probably go better when we text more at that point.","Had a date Thursday.  She offered to pick me up which was interesting and I figured I would accept and see how it went.  We went to a Korean place she had recommended after talking about how much I love trying new restaurants and I'd never had Korean food.  I thought the date was pretty decent although maybe nothing amazing.  She was cute and the conversation kept going. She dropped me off, I probably should have gone for a kiss then but being in the passenger seat of her car made it awkward.  Not long after she texted saying she had a great time  and was glad I liked the restaurant.  I asked this morning if she would be up for a brewery trivia later this week, ~~but no response yet so I'm thinking she's not interested even though I was thinking she was.~~ and she said yes, so that's cool.\n\nIn other news not much activity on the apps so not likely to have any other dates this week.\n\nI can feel my abs under my stomach and I'm feeling like I want to go a little harder on my current cut since I was slacking and stalling a bit last week.  Keeping up my current workout routine and hoping for good results.  I've got this big scar on my stomach and the fat kind of builds up around it so it's a big horizontal indentation on my stomach, and as I've lost weight and built up the muscle underneath, I think it's been flattening out a bit, so that's cool.   Maybe I'll be able to have a decent looking stomach someday after all.","Hmm, I don't think your profile seems very sti-\n\n&amp;gt;mayonnaise does NOT belong on a @#$! hamburger.\n\nAww, hell no.\n\nI felt your profile was a little disjointed between talking the talk about being progressive and making the world a better place, but when it comes down to it you're about MMA, video games, and yuppie pursuits. It's a presented as a little too consistently true for it to come across as an irony you can poke fun at.\n\nOther than that I quite liked it. Some nitpicks:\n\nFirst sentence is a little off-putting. It fits the tone of your profile but I would suggest easing into it a bit.\n\nThe rest of that paragraph doesn't make much sense to me. You say \"I'm just as comfortable doing W and X as Y and Z,\" but W, X, Y and Z are all very similarly bougie and W and X seem to have nothing more in common with each other than with Y and Z. You then go on to wax hyperbolic about how much variety you have in your life, even though there is next to no variety in what you've told us about yourself so far; everything you've listed could easily be done within the walls of a single museum on a single day. \n\nI would stay away from Art of War (in particular) and Pulp Fiction (to a lesser degree). Even if these are legitimately your favorites, they're very cliche and people may assume a certain pseudo-intellectualism. \n\nThe \"To me... meaning is simple\" is awkward, I would shorten it to one sentence. I also usually avoid using \"let's\" and \"we\" and other words that sound presumptuous on a dating profile The way you use it in your summary could also be taken to mean everyone and not just the reader, so it's probably fine.","After a couple of weeks of messaging, I met this guy from another town. I waited for him for like 25min, during which he was messaging me like he has no idea where we're supposed to meet (he chose the spot and he's been there a million times). Finally he shows up from a totally nonsensical direction and when I asked why the hell did he go there he said 'Oh I was just curious why not' (?? from what I've later learned he probably just stood somewhere watching me wait for him).\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay whatever, we go to a nice popular bar with a garden and we spend 1h talking about topics he chose which were really random, like I'm a zero sex interest. No chemistry between us. But at least it's not unpleasant, until he just asks 'You wanna go for a walk?'. Okay fine, I get it, you're bored so we go and walk for 2 hours.  I would've said No if he didn't have to drive for 90min to get there so I play along. I get really frustrated and tired and decide to call it a day. He didn't even want to kiss my cheek when saying good bye so I figure 'Well at least it makes sense, he was disappointed sexually, we hung a bit and that's it'.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nA week passed and he gets all curious why I'm not messaging him anymore, so I explain how it's fine that he's not into me, at least we had a nice talk and a walk. Then he goes crazy calling me a silly bitch, wasn't it obvious how much he liked me, he might be in love, how I should have been satisfied with the fact he just wanted to look at me (he didn't look at me when we walked, so why push the idea of walk), why does everything have to be so physical etc.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, in the weeks that followed I found out he's got a sweet mix of Oedipus, Borderline and Peter Pan, he's totally gay but chases women and he never really had sex. Poor thing. I offered to lend a helping ear but he sent me a 30 A4 page long essay how I should change my personality or I'll die alone.\n\nYou can't make this stuff up...","After 3.5 years together, we were planning to move across the country for his job and had been talking marriage. Living together with him was the happiest I'd ever been in a relationship, and I knew he felt the same way. I'd said goodbye to all my friends, given my boss notice, broken our lease on our apartment, then four days before the movers were scheduled to come: \n\n\"I'm having doubts about our relationship.\"\n\nI couldn't wrap my head around such a sudden change of heart as I was totally blindsided, he really had hid it well up until that point, so we stayed together...for about two more weeks. He ended things over the phone when he was safely 300 miles away, and everything I owned except for what I could fit in a suitcase was already on a moving truck on its way out there. In hindsight I'm glad that the relationship ended, but the way it happened was pretty traumatic.","&amp;gt; SHOW INTEREST. It seems like a no-brainer, but apparently that’s not the case. It’s insane how few guys even initiate conversation or try at all in the beginning. It’s like they figure there’s always something better around the corner, so whatever. Either pursue me and make your intentions clear or get away from me.\n\nI don't want to say anything unless I feel you'll react positively to it, plus I don't automatically assume that women being nice to me are into me, so I keep my mouth shut for fear of looking like an idiot. And the whole \"chase me\" thing is a stupid game you can't win. Stop chasing someone, \"you're boring and not willing to fight for what you want, go away!\" Keep chasing someone, \"no means no, asshole, this is harassment, go away!\" I will agree with you on making your intentions clear from the start - hanging around someone and hoping they'll read your mind and feel the same way is a recipe for disaster - but it works both ways.\n\n&amp;gt; TALK TO ME. Have an actual, legitimate conversation with me. Get to know me. Make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. Don’t send me two texts and then ghost. I don’t want to waste another minute of my time on something that’s going absolutely nowhere. Either act interested or don’t bother in the first place.\n\nI don't want to waste my time either. I don't want to invest in anyone unless I feel like it'll actually go somewhere. I can ask you the deepest philosophical questions there are, but if all you give me are curt, one-word answers then I assume you're not interested.\n\n&amp;gt; CALL ME. No one calls anyone anymore, and it drives me insane. If you’re trying to ask someone out, you should call that person. End of story. I don’t want to be asked out over text, or even worse, online. That means you didn’t even make the effort to get my phone number.\n\n I can't read your mind to figure out how *you* want to be asked out. Plus times have changed, this is the era of texting and apps, maybe you should lower your standards and join the rest of us in the 21st century.\n\n&amp;gt; ASK ME OUT. For real. Over the phone. On a date. Don’t ask me to hang out, or chill, or whatever people are saying these days. I’m not that girl. I want someone who appreciates me as a person and wants to take me on a real date. If you’re too lazy to do so, then lose my number. I don’t need you to take me somewhere fancy, but at least put some thought into it.\n\nSee previous.\n\n&amp;gt; SHUT UP ABOUT YOURSELF. You finally get to a first date, and he spends the entire time jabbering away about his own life and problems. I didn’t sign up to be your therapist, dude. Reality check: this doesn’t show how open and vulnerable you are. It shows how narcissistic, self-absorbed, and insecure you are. I want to get to know you, obviously, but we’re never going to work out if you don’t spend some time listening to me, too.\n\nYou want me to, as per point 2, have an actual, legitimate conversation with you, get to know you, make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. So you want me to ask all about you, but you don't want to ask at all about me? A conversation takes two people, lady, and you're presumably trying to find out about me just as much as I'm trying to find out about you. Maybe you should shut up for a while and learn about me. Just because I reveal things about myself doesn't mean I think you're my therapist.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW SOME RESPECT. I am a strong and independent woman. I don’t want a guy to be intimidated by me. I do want a man to respect me as an equal and treat me as such. My independence definitely doesn’t mean you get to abandon your manners and courtesy. I want someone who still opens doors, pulls out chairs, and gets up on the subway to give an older person his seat. No respect, no date.\n\nYou're \"strong\" and \"independent\" and \"want a man to respect me as an equal\", but you still want me to open doors for you, pull out your chair for you, etc? So you want me to treat you like a dainty flower that can't do anything for herself. Or you want me to treat you like royalty. That's not equality either way, that's treating you with exceptionalism. I'd respect you more if you could at least admit that.\n\n&amp;gt; THINK OF INTERESTING DATES. If you’ve actually talked to me and taken some time to get to know what I like, you can do better than the overdone \"dinner and a movie\" date. If you haven’t, I don’t want to go out with you anyway. When I plan our dates, I’m going to be creative, and I expect the same from you.\n\nI'm sure there are better date ideas than dinner and a movie, but I also don't want to date someone that expects to be impressed with something novel each time. All I'm hearing from this point is \"entertain me\". And you talk about when you plan dates, but I've got a feeling that you actually expect *me* to do all the planning and setting up the arrangements. This makes you sound very high maintenance, and I personally am not into that.\n\n&amp;gt; COMPLIMENT ME. Strong, independent women still want to be complimented. Every woman likes hearing that she’s pretty, funny, intelligent, and wonderful. This problem baffles me more than anything else. It’s so easy to pay a compliment, and yet most men simply don’t bother. WTF?\n\nI have no objections to this one.\n\n&amp;gt; TREAT ME WELL. I will treat you well, but I want to know that you’ll do the same as well. I’ve been in too many situations where I was a great girlfriend to a terrible boyfriend. I’m wary of going there again, so sorry — you’re going to have to prove yourself.\n\nI question how \"great\" a girlfriend you were and how \"terrible\" your boyfriends were given how narcissistic you sound so far, but it's a common enough feeling that I'll take your word for it. It boils down to the conundrum with dating in general - neither of us wants to invest in the other until we're sure the other won't disappoint us. I expect you to prove yourself to me just as much as you expect me to prove myself to you. At some point we're going to have to trust each other, otherwise one of us is moving on.\n\n&amp;gt; CONSIDER MY FEELINGS. Yes, this is a component of a mature relationship. You have to think about someone besides yourself. You can’t just make whatever decision you want without thinking about whether it might hurt me. This means you need to tell me if you’re seeing other people, and you can’t just spout insensitive crap out of your mouth. All I ask is that you’re a considerate human being.\n\nAre you going to consider my feelings in return? And if I accidentally say something you perceive as insensitive, are you going to let me know so that I can learn not to say it again? Or are you going to go cold on me and not communicate with me?\n\n&amp;gt; UNDERSTAND THAT I’M WORTH IT. I can’t date any more men who don’t put in any effort. I know that I’m worthy of a great guy, and it drives me crazy that so many jerks don’t see it. Obviously they aren’t the right men for me, but I’m so tired of waiting around for one who is. When is someone going to man up and decide he wants me for his own?\n\nSo far you seem to define \"effort\" as \"someone who will show their entire hand to me without seeing any of my cards\". You want a guy to pursue you, treat you like a queen, and act completely invested in you, all without any show of promise that you'll do likewise for them. Maybe you keep dating men who don't appear to put in any effort because you're not putting in any effort? It's a two-way street, lady.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW ME YOU CARE. I’m pretty chill, but don’t treat me like one of your bros. Make at least little gestures to show that you’re interested and that you appreciate me as a person. It can be as small as a sweet, lingering kiss or brushing my hair away from my face. Just some little way of showing you care is always appreciated.\n\nEveryone expresses their love and affection in different ways. Either learn to recognize someone's style, or just ask them for the type of affection that you want. And why would I give someone I just met a lingering kiss or brush their hair away? That's getting too far into someone's personal space too soon. It takes time to build that sort of affection and trust.\n\n&amp;gt; TRY YOUR BEST. I’m not asking for perfection here. Just make a little effort, and I’ll be happy. What drives me insane are all the guys who simply don’t try at all. It’s extremely upsetting and frustrating. I’m starting to feel like it’s me, but I refuse to lower my standards just because men don’t seem to be capable of meeting them.\n\nI somehow doubt you're not looking for perfection, or that you'd actually be satisfied with someone putting in a \"little\" effort. But at least you've got some self-awareness.\n\n&amp;gt; CHALLENGE ME. Talk to me. Ask me deep questions. Find out what makes me tick. I want to connect on a deeper level, and I want someone who is all about doing that, too. Help make me want to be the best I can be every single day. There’s no point for me to bring another person into my life unless we’re going to benefit each other.\n\nThis is just a rehash of a few of the above points and requires no further rebuttal.\n\n&amp;gt; CONNECT WITH ME. I’m not looking for some surface BS, so if that’s all you want, let me know upfront. Don’t try to trick me into thinking you want more so you can get laid. I’m so done with that sneaky, dishonest behavior. Either put effort into what we have, or don’t even bother starting anything with me.\n\nSee previous.\n\nMost of this can be condensed into \"I don't want to invest in someone unless they've invested in me\". Fair enough, I'm sure it's a universal condition, but the entire thing as worded comes off as entitled. The only line it was missing was \"are there any good men out there still?\"\n\ntldr; I put way too much effort into this.","The 3 one sided responses in a row is kind of my barometer too. If I ask questions on 3 messages and don't get asked a question back, I usually just stop messaging. I don't unmatch though, because I find that a decent amount of girls will eventually reach back out if they're truly interested. By cutting off communication when it's not reciprocated it makes it obvious that she has to be an equal participant in conversation for me to invest my time in her. \n\nExample: I got one girl's number Wednesday, she didn't ask a question back 3 straight times so I stopped messaging her. She reached out last night and we've been talking since. If she hadn't, it wouldn't have bothered me. I've found that a girl (or person) will respond as she did if they're truly interested. People who exchange a couple/few messages and fade never were truly that interested in the first place.\n\nEDIT: Yes, engaged responses can replace a question sometimes as well. But if it's a conversation where the other party is never asking me any questions, then I'm gonna lose interest, flat out. ","Best guess would be that she wasn't feeling the sexual attraction. Now this isn't always the case, but because you said this is what always happens to you it sounds like 3 dates means she liked you and was hoping that attraction would come, but it just didn't.\n\nLet me ask you this. Did you kiss her? Hold her hand? Anything romantic/sexual? Obviously you hopefully see signs before you do that, but I'm asking because maybe she was hoping you would make a move but didn't. \n\nAnother question, was she the only girl you were dating? Did you keep messaging/swiping/keeping an eye out for meeting other people in real life while you were dating her? If you're like the old me, then the answers no. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with dating one person at a time, focusing on them and really trying to get to know them. Unfortunately, that may come across as \"needy,\" always being available to go out whenever she's free. Obviously you could make your life busy with other things besides dating other people, hobbies, career, friends, whatever. This point was meant to be, did you seem like you had your own awesome life that would be interesting enough to her that she might want to stick around and be a part of that, or was your life somewhat centered around dating her?\n\nLastly, and be honest with yourself and us, are you confident? If you didn't make a move in 3 dates, I'll wager the answer is no. Confidence is very sexy, for men and women. Being confident in yourself and knowing that you have a ton to offer, are interesting, funny, and that any woman would be lucky to get a date with you is very obvious. That doesn't mean arrogant and a douche, but knowing that you are worth someones time and attention. Men and women can sense when someone is confident in themselves, and this is something I think you need to work on. Realize that you are an interesting and likeable dude. You wouldn't be getting three dates with women if you weren't. First date is a feeler, is this guy normal, not going to murder me, and interesting enough that I'd want to get to know him more? You're passing this test. Second date, lets see if it wasn't a fluke and he is secretly crazy, is he still funny or was that a fluke, can he hold a more meaningful conversation, is he nice? You're passing this test, and the third date for most people is at least a, did I feel attracted to him? Did we kiss/did he make me wish we'd kissed? Any physical contact, if not I guess maybe he's not interested? You're failing this test. The good news is, once you figure this part out, I think you'll go from not getting past the third date, to 6,7,8th date territory and maybe more. It may be that this is the only hurdle you've got stopping you from having whatever it is you want when it comes to dating/relationships. Personally, I'm hung up on the 3 month mark. No date number it varies, but as 3 months approaches and things start to get serious they bail. I used to only come across as the fun/fling guy. I think I've figured out my problem and am pretty sure that with the current women I'm talking to/dating when I pick one I like I'll get past my hurdle. Hope this helped in some way and you get past yours my man. Chin up, it's a learning process!","The first one sounds like a no, make maybe one more attempt to have a convo \\(or not\\) and move on and dont waste your time.\n\nThe second one sounds like a no, too, but i dont think you \"blow it\" by asking someone on a date as long as it was handed respectfully.  She may just be a validation seeker, so I wouldn't invest much effort into that one unless she engages more.\n\nThe question about how to keep up talking once a date is set is hard.  Typically the closer in the more likely it is to happen, but I found that sending a text here or there between scheduling the date and it happening helps me gauge what their communication style is.  If you're concerned she flew the coop, just make sure to send a follow\\-up the day before the date and confirm the plans \\(Hey looking forward to seeing you at \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ tomorrow\\).\n\nYou're probably right on your math, but people are different and any hard rules are going to exclude someone \\(ive had someone flake on the same day, and another date get scheduled a month out go swimmingly\\).  You have to decide what your threshold for interest is in OLD and act accordingly.  For me, if the woman doesnt seem as interested in me as I am in her, I dont bother trying to chase.  ","I think both of my relationships started as very equally reciprocated interactions. Both of them wanted to talk to me, gave thoughtful responses, asked questions of me, and made it obvious they were interested in me. \n\nI think the most upvoted post in here describes my overall experience to a T. Most women can't be bothered to be anything resembling moderately enthusiastic. They don't ever reach out and start conversation, even after date 1 and the worst part to me is that they don't ask questions of me when we're actually talking. It just ends up feeling like I'm asking questions at someone who couldn't care less about me and learning who I am. I need to be courted as well, and I dont like the implied assumption that women need to be won over, but that it doesn't go the other way around as well. I'm buying stock in someone, not selling myself to someone, and very few girls look at it that way. \n\nSo I've hardened my rules now and don't put up with that shit anymore. Example:  got a girl's number today, sent her 3 texts asking her thoughtful questions, she didn't ever respond with a question. I'm gonna take that as disinterest and move on. Talking to a wall isn't fun. I'm not desperate and I'm gonna focus on trying going on fewer dates that are higher quality. \n\nIt's so rare to find a girl that actually reciprocates interest or effort early on that it does get a bit depressing.","I'm just confused.\n\nI was by myself in my own world at the bar for a drink Friday night, and getting ready to leave.\n\nDrunk girl next to me decides to start a conversation by asking me if I'm gay, because I'm drinking white.  Then she asks if I'm married, dating someone, finally we settle on single.  Apparently this is confusing to her because she thinks I'm attractive (bad lighting and a lot of booze seem to do me favors) and I didn't bother trying to chat her single friend up.\n\nThey spend a lot of effort trying to make fun of me for drinking white wine.\n\nHer friend is cute.  We have a brief moment of good conversation.\n\nI get her number and leave after they go out to smoke.\n\nI text her the next night after I finish my test just to see what's up.\n\nShe basically defaults right back to trying to make fun about my drinking white wine.\n\nMy question: is having a glass of white wine *really* that big of a deal?\n\nAlso IDK if I should try texting the cute friend, just let it go, skip texting and suggest a drinks date, skip texting and suggest a dinner date.","He may have just been out in a social situation where texting would have been inappropriate/dead phone or on a date with another person. It also could be that they’re simply an inconsistent texter. Lots of guys run off the momentum of initial spark but seriously suck at initiating and maintaining communication after. Given the short time span right now, I’d be reticent to make any general assumptions about it, but I’d certainly ask what he did yesterday and mention you noticed the radio silence (assuming date still happens). \n\nIf you continue to date, try to be clear about texting expectations, as it is unfortunately common practice for many many guys to just stop putting in effort texting or calling when in person dates are happening.","Take more initiative. Whenever a girl doesn't suggest a date, I'm going to suggest going out for drinks. If you don't want to be in that situation, start messaging guys yourself. Also, just because a guy goes out all the time doesn't mean he's not educated. I'm liberal, conversational, well educated and proper. But I like drinking. Those aren't mutually exclusive things.\n\nWhen you're talking to guys, ask them how they typically spend their weekends. If you never want to go to bars or clubs, you could even ask a question like \"What would you prefer to do on a Friday night in general? Go out for drinks and shut the bar down or spend a quiet night in?\" \n\nAlso as far as \"hookups\" go, not every guy wants a hookup if he is physically driven so I caution you against saying guys that go out just want to drink and fuck. Personally, I don't really become emotionally connected to someone I'm seeing until sex happens, so if anything, I'm trying to connect MORE with my partner when I'm advancing things physically. Flat out, I'm far more interested in women once we've gotten physical because I actually feel desired by them. This isn't all guys, but I just wanted to provide that perspective.\n\nI take it you want to advance slowly physically and meet someone serious, so my suggestions are:\n\n* Take more time talking to someone before you meet and KEEP THEM INTERESTED. What this requires of you is reaching out and starting/keeping conversation going during the time you talk to them before meeting. I'm substantially more serious about women that demonstrate they want to get to know me and show enthusiasm about meeting me.\n\n* Weeknight dates that are neutral site dates (not close enough that you could very easily go back to one of your places). ","I can keep it light before the first date, but after the first date, I'm not gonna hold back and I'll text them as much as I feel like is right. Flat out, I feel more comfortable and first dates go better for me when there's a decent amount of texting beforehand. I'm a pretty frequent texter, so I'll probably annoy the piss out of someone who doesn't want to text a decent amount and I'm comfortable with that. And I get kind of annoyed/bored with people who suck at texting. I like to keep conversation going between seeing each other. It's honestly almost better to get that out of the way early and know what we can each expect. \n\nLike I said, before the first date? I'll mirror their texting patterns/frequency for the most part because neither of us has any clue how things will go. If she's pretty responsive, I'll just text her as much as I feel like. If she's not responsive, I won't text her for a couple days to see if she texts me of her own volition, rather than forcing a conversation. If she feels no need to talk to me between dates, I'll also know we're not a good fit.\n\nOP, I think you're totally fair to be a bit reserved about texting because guys can definitely get overeager and overinvested before a first date. The way I'd try to frame it is that right or wrong, they're coming on too strong because they don't get a ton of opportunities. From stories like this, you can tell pretty easily these type of guys don't go on dates very often. It comes off as desperate and unattractive, and is largely why I hold off on texting a ton before first dates. Once a girl has met me, she can see that there's nothing weird about me and it'll probably go better when we text more at that point.","It's hard for guys, those who are pretty decent are also very conscious of not putting pressure on the girls they're interested in. Sadly that respect can come across as disinterest but most guys will tell you if they're not interested. He's probably not going to go out with someone he doesn't like. Probably\n\n&amp;gt;how can I make sure that I'm not annoying him over text or coming off as too intense and that he actually wants to continue to spend time with me?\n\nI would say just be yourself. If you suspect that he may not be interested, maybe he always takes a day to respond to your messages say, then you're going to have to ask him point blank. Personally if someone doesn't want to talk to me then I'm not going to be happy even if they say they're interested. So part of that is knowing what you want and need and making sure you get it.\n\n&amp;gt;How concerned should I be about the stereotypes of guys wanting the chase since I've made myself so available to him?\n\nI really hate this Zombie myth. Why would someone want to chase a person that's not interested in them? Who's going to waste their time to be repeatedly rejected?","This is common and there are tons of reasons for it:\n\n- they didn’t like your message.\n- they have better options.\n- upon closer inspection, they changed their mind.\n- they are already date saturated.\n- they misunderstand the purpose of \"like\" functionality or don't care.\n- they haven't read your message(s).\n- they are currently too busy to start anything new.\n- they use dating apps out of boredom/curiosity and are unlikely to follow through.\n\nRegardless, the answer is: don't worry about it and move on.\nThe rate you are getting matches is fine, you just need to rememeber that online dating is inherently fickle and try your best to not take any of it personally.\n\nIf you think there is something causing this response and you want help, you can post your profile to this sub for advise/critique.","This is common and there are tons of reasons for it:\n\n- they didn’t like your message.\n- they have better options.\n- upon closer inspection, they changed their mind.\n- they are already date saturated.\n- they misunderstand the purpose of \"like\" functionality or don't care.\n- they haven't read your message(s).\n- they are currently too busy to start anything new.\n- they use dating apps out of boredom/curiosity and are unlikely to follow through.\n\nRegardless, the answer is: don't worry about it and move on.

There are tons of people on dating apps, and if you use a few of them you should have as many options as you need.\n\nActually finding a relationship has been difficult. Many people are non-monogamous or into very specific things sexually, so that can limit options depending on your preferences. Many people are very focused on their careers and keep very busy both in and out of work, so scheduling and emotional availability can be difficult to pin down. The Bay Area is famously expensive, so even going out for drinks can be pricy. High housing prices and the nature of tech startups mean that people are rarely in stable housing or career situations, so I think a lot of people have trouble with the idea of “settling down.” Many people are not from here, so if you meet someone and they have plans to move to Seattle in three years and you don’t want to do that, then that’s a problem.","&amp;gt; With the slight boost in morale I messaged some of these people and most of them didn't respond since\n\nIt is extremely common to not have a message replied to in online dating (including mutual likes), this likely has a lot less to do with you or your messages than you think.\n\n&amp;gt; No one is going to be with someone like me.\n\nI highly doubt that, for several reasons:\n\n- overall, physical appearance is the #1 thing people care about, and by the sounds of it you are doing fine in this department.\n- despite your severe lack of socialization over the last many years, you seem relatively self aware and well spoken, this is already better than a lot of people.\n- if you find your personality/life bland, you can always substitute a bit of your work out time for something else.

Again v. good pictures.\n","I listened to the whole thing over work, and I thought it was an interesting accompanying note to what I've been personally learning as of late about social isolation.\n\nI think I grew up not really able to rely on anyone really for emotional support and this evolved into this idealized attitude of human rationality. That is, by college, I concluded that my emotional stresses would be best resolved through introspection, and that I would work through my internal ruminations of self-actualization via the lens of private reflection. I didn't think emotions were a sign of vulnerability because of a societal pressure for masculinity, but that emotions were irrational, illogical or senseless. The thought was that eschewing emotionalism would leave behind only the objective portions of any issue, and that as an engineer, I could then work to resolve it. I went through my first breakup during college, and this line of thinking worked for me -- I resolved my insecurities and developed motivations for self-improvement that carry though even today.\n\nBut I've been learning lately that this sort of social/emotional connection mentioned in the podcast is kind of a natural part of humanity. Even from a rational perspective, carrying out a self-imposed social isolation is probably a sub-optimal solution. This podcast affirms some of my recent conclusions about the importance of having available a relationship with people you are comfortable with sharing the kind of inner feelings and life discussions that goes beyond simple familiarity and common interests.\n\nAs an example, recently I had a co-worker/friend write some negative comments about me in a review, and it upset me in ways that I didn't even understand myself. I spent quite some time rationalizing reasons for why I was upset, and even though I could come up with conclusions as to why I was so agitated and the path forward to coming to terms with a given result, I didn't get over it easily. That is, until I shared my reasoning to a close friend - and just the act of sharing improved my mood and state of mind overall. I know that this is probably an extremely obvious conclusion for many (ie, getting things off your chest makes you feel better), but I think it's being heavily underplayed for a lot of men, whether it's due to pressures of masculinity or objectivism.\n\ntl;dr, It was a good listen and helped me reflect a bit more about who I am and want to become. Thanks.\n","Honestly, I started making every single first date a brewery/drinks date at a location where we could sit close to each other, rather than across from each other at a table. You can punctuate jokes/stories/statements with physical touch and build physical comfort and tension throughout the date. \n\nI also focused on learning how to display positive body language as well as reading other people's body language. If you get good enough at it, you honestly can create positive body language in the other person through your own actions, which carries over to a great date more often than not.\n\nEver since I've become more physically forward on dates, I make the decision on if there will be a second date 9/10 times. Even the last few girls that didn't feel a connection, I texted them directly after the date letting them know I wasn't interested in pursuing anything further. I think the fact that most of my first dates involve me kissing them within the first couple hours and a good amount end up at my place makes them more impactful/memorable. I would never suggest everyone be as physically forward like I am though, because you have to have the confidence and not be hesitant at all if you're gonna pull it off, it has to be authentic to you. But I can't act like I didn't see a massive change when I started being more physically forward, because it made me more polarizing and killed any chance of me giving off platonic vibes. ","I grew up with strict, academic-focused Asian parents.

My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe.

Honest it's nothing against you if I'm not looking you in the eyes while we talk. It's actually because I'm going for the high-score of minimal social contact while communicating physically so I can compete at national levels for social awkwardness. (No not really, but I do require a bit of patience when easing into social interaction!)\n\nUm I kind of read more of it; it's not all so bad.\n\nI'd just really recommend better pictures, avoid talking about yourself negatively, and keep things much shorter and to the point.\n\nAt this point, OkC is sort of a glorified swipe app with more robust profiles.","We all learn things from relationships. Sometimes we learn we took what we had for granted and learn to appreciate partners in ways we didn't before. Sometimes we learn that we have to put ourselves first and that our needs have to come first. \n\nIt sounds like a lesson you've learned from your recent relationships is that communication and transparency is crucial.  And honestly, I couldn't agree more. I had one without great communication for 3.5 years, and 1 for 1 year with amazing communication, and the 1-year relationship felt way stronger.  From the relationship with your ex you saw recently, you clearly learned that you can't let things go unaddressed and have to nip things in the bud before they fester and grow into messes that can't be fixed. I think that's a pretty valuable lesson to learn and take with you. If you're fully transparent and communicative from day 1, and create an environment where communication is encouraged, it should continue throughout the relationship. \n\nAlso, try to look at every single date/relationship/interpersonal interaction as something you can learn from. I feel like from every single date you can refine your process a bit and refine what you are (and aren't) looking for in a partner. Even the bad relationships should be lessons you can learn from.\n\nAnd please don't pain yourself with the \"What ifs\" about past relationships. You broke up for a reason, remember that, and try not to focus on only the positive nostalgia. There was enough negative that the relationships ended too. There's nothing wrong with having a high opinion of one of your exes and thinking they were a good person, but they were incompatible with you and you ended things. Focus on the mindset you were in when you made that decision, and move forward without second guessing what you did. Focusing on the past can paralyze you.","I think everyone should have a good period of time where they are single. It is important that we as individuals have time to really focus on our own self growth and to establish within ourselves who we truly are as a person. Often times, you can lose sight of yourself when in a relationship, especially when you are the type to always put others first and leave yourself behind. Take the single days of your life as an opportunity to become a stronger and more secure person.","Incoming lurker rant:\n\nI've been lurking all over the interwebs trying to find ways to improve my OLD profiles and messages and whatever other digital nonsense comes before a first date with people I'm not meeting through work. The whole process is exhausting and I think reading other people's comments on the internet only frustrates me or makes me feel like a misanthrope when I'm really not one. \n\nOn one hand, I know I shouldn't be emotionally investing too much into any particular matches and I'd be objectively lucky to break a 5-10% response rate, but I've been putting the work and time in for a month now to zero responses. That's not to say I've gotten zero likes, zero matches, or even zero matches from people I messaged before they liked me. Just that, even in the best case, people will see my profile, see my message, like me, and then never reply to the message.\n\nOn the other hand, I spent a good 6 years after my last LTR ended focusing on myself. I did a lot of great shit work/career/education wise. I ditched a lot of bad habits and personality traits. I developed friendships and hobbies. I've even lost a dozen pounds over the past couple months, though I'm only 200lbs (5'8\") so it's not like I'm morbidly obese to begin with. In all that time, I've been asked out once. By a 19 year old co-worker :/. \n\nSo as nice as it would be to chill out and let people come to me, I don't trust it to happen. I need to be putting myself out there and trying real hard if I'm going to be seen over the tidal wave of other men on the internet. Doing all that and still failing is just soul crushing, though. /rant","Yup! While it wasn’t the worst date I’ve ever had, it wasn’t exactly stellar (I believe I may have referred to it as a “dud” to my best friend). I wasn’t really planning on seeing him again (I didn’t get the sense that he was actually into me), so I was surprised to hear back from him. \nBut I was still pretty hesitant as to whether or not I wanted to go for a second date... until I slipped a disc in my back.  I was out of commission for a month or so, and during that time he would message me a couple of times a week just to ask how I was doing. He was never pressuring or frustrated when my back took a lot longer to heal than I thought it would, he just genuinely cared about my wellbeing. And before I knew it, I not only wanted to see him again, I was excited about it. \nOur second date was everything our first date should have been and more.  So now we refer to that night as our second first date.","I'm 39/f with a kid and I had a fairly successful relationship with a guy who was 34 without kids.  He had a previous LTR with another single mom so I think that obviously helped and I appreciated that he was open to it, but it can happen/work.  I think you need to be upfront about your intentions obviously, what do you want?  Do you even like kids?  Is she looking for something serious, does she want to date around?  And as others said, be flexible and ready for someone who can't be around 24/7 or at your place in necessarily a moment's notice.  With work and custody schedules they may only be available a few days a week, every other weekend or something like that.  I think my ex liked it in that at least he had his own space to do things, hang with friends, and not need to devote all of his free time to me.  In the beginning I did not allow any sleepovers at my place on nights I had my son and I think I didn't even introduce him until around 3\\-4 months.  \n\nIf you are wanting something long term/serious, yes be prepared to possibly be someone's stepdad at some point, but that's wayyyy down the road.  Keep it in the back of your mind perhaps but don't focus on that.

I would not. It seems bitter. \n\nYou also have written cringe WAY too many times. More times than should ever be in your profile. \n\nHonestly I am much older than you so I am not your target audience, but nothing about your profile is appealing. All I can tell is that you like memes and video games. ","&amp;gt;A lot of people are telling me to put full pictures of me. I'm aware that if I do this I'll have less messages and it scares me because even know I barely have a few. But I guess that if it's what everybody says, I should try this\n\nI would agree with those people. It's no different than lying about your height. Sure, if you put 6'0 you'll get more messages and first dates, but they'll see immediately that you're not actually 6'0 and if that bothers them, you'll have just wasted your own time as well as theirs. I'd rather have one fantastic first date with a person who liked me for *me* every month than 10 dates that got started from a false impression and went nowhere as a result. ","&amp;gt; He stopped me and said he didn't think it was a good idea himself because...are you ready for this...he had a good thing going with someone he recently met. WTF?! \n\nI've had this happen to me multiple times. I think it's usually the guy panicking about commitment so he decides to see if he can still pull some dates. Then he realizes that he wanted what he had all along. \n\n&amp;gt; Am I supposed to read cues on a date so as not to feel this mortified?\n\nI haven't been able to! I think it's why I try and date a bunch of people at once, so I don't get too enamored with one before we're both on the same page. \n\n&amp;gt; I'm gonna go back to my hometown Fuckboy City and just never form a connection as real as that. And what the fuck is wrong with me, getting smitten in just two dates?!\n\nThis is a normal way to feel, but don't be too hard on yourself. I've felt this way but gone on to make even better connections, and more than just once.","&amp;gt;Sex is more important than Starbucks.\n\n&amp;gt;Millennials prefer a steamy romp to a steamy macchiato.

","I try to not be having sex with more than one person at a time (OK that's never been an option for me, but in theory if i were able to spin plates that would be my line in the sand), but talking to and going out w/ multiple people at the same time would be ideal as you (may) have the opportunity to pick the person who you think is the best fit, rather than simply getting with whomever will have you.","A variety of reasons.  \n1. I don't really care. Any time the prospect of a possible relationship comes up, I just can't see the benefit, the \"what's in it for me?\". People demand so much, expect you to live up to some narrow expectation, and yet have all these flaws themselves you have to compromise on. I rarely meet anyone admirable anymore, despite they might think everyone else is not up to their standards.  \n2. I've had braces since Feb 17 with surgery that was planned for Jan18 and keeps getting pushed back. I don't really want to try to date while I have three months of difficult recovery.  \n3. I'm very much the type who only had eyes for one person at a time. Even if I don't know if or in all trying to scope of whether the person I might be interested in is single, married etc. So half a dozen woven have contacted me in the last few weeks and given they've all been extremely low effort, un-interesting messages, I've just gone \"meh\".

Not the best combo tbh, but trying to make it work. ","You wake up in the morning. Your alarm hasn't gone off, you can just feel the sunlight streaming in through your eyelids. You think about all the things you have to do that day - wake up, make food, shower, get in the car and sit in traffic, go to your shitty job with your asshole boss and annoying coworkers. Stare at the clock as the hours drag by, get back in traffic, go to the grocery store, stand in line under flickering lights so you can buy something to put in your empty fridge. Get back in traffic, go home... It all feels so overwhelming. Another long, long day.\n\nAnd then you open your eyes, and on the other side of your bed, another person. Asleep, still smiling. The sun playing over their hair, and the little bit of their shoulder showing over the covers. You watch them, for a quiet minute, while they breathe in and out. And you know that you can get through your day - no matter how shitty and long it is, because at the end of it you get to come back in this room and crawl back in bed with this person who loves and understands you, who likes to kiss you on the neck and cook you late night pancakes and tell you how wonderful they think you are. Who you can have sweaty passionate sex with and who will hold you afterwards and tell you that you rock their world. That they want to spend the rest of their life with you. That they will go anywhere with you. That just looking at you makes them weak in the knees.\n\nThat's why you keep trying, I guess.","I don't know if I'm in your target demo (I'm probably a lot less \"career-driven\" than you'd prefer, though I am \"well-educated\"), but I certainly go on a lot of dates with people that sound like you. And a decent portion of the time, my experience is that the person I'm meeting is attractive, confident, intelligent, affable... and kind of boring. And that doesn't even mean that I can't have a good conversation with them - they're often well-read, well-spoken and insightful. But to make a huge stereotype based on a relatively small (but not trivial) sample size, I feel like a lot of people who are *very* career/accomplishment-driven are missing some or all of three things that I look for:\n\n1. **Sense of humor**. I don't really mean this in the sense of \"you laugh at and occasionally make jokes\" or that you're (barf) \"fluent in sarcasm.\" I mean you genuinely enjoy seeing the humor in life, often joke about \"big/serious\" topics, have a sense of irony, and don't take anything too seriously. Yes, you can do all these things and still be a \"type-A\" person who's committed to your career. I've met a few like that, but not the majority.\n2. **You're genuinely passionate about something other than your day job**. Things that don't count: politics, religion, fitness. Not that being passionate about those things is bad, they're just not particularly interesting. I want someone who isn't so devoted to their job that there isn't room for other interests in their life, which leads to...\n3. **You value human relationships at least as much as your career**, and demonstrate that through your decisions and priorities. A lot of people claim to do this, but are still okay with working 60 hours a week while spending 10 on quality time with their partner. Granted, this isn't something you can necessarily discern on a first date, but it is something that's resulted in relationships ending for me in the past. Bottom line: if I feel like your top priority/sense of fulfillment in life is the thing you get paid for, instead of the people who are important to you, I'm not interested.\n\nAgain, the above criteria might just as easily disqualify me from your perspective, and that's fine! But I do think I have qualities that a lot of \"successful\" women claim to be seeking in a partner, and bemoan the lack of in the \"successful\" men they date. ","Assuming this isn't a Monkey's Paw type thing:\n\n* Interested in enough things that I am to enjoy spending time together but has interests which do not overlap with mine\n* Cosplays at anime conventions\n* Is intelligent and well spoken\n* Someone who I can actually date without hitting any deal breakers (Single, within driving distance, no hard drugs, no kids)\n* Has a sex drive that leads to sex more than once a month\n* Has a relatively positive personality \n* A career which provides just enough money that she can take care of her own bills and save a little bit\n* Is attracted to me and can communicate that with me in a way that I can understand emotionally\n* Is a woman who is romantically and sexually attracted to men\n\nAND THE MOST UNREALISTIC OF THEM ALL\n\n* Will find me attractive enough of a person to want marriage, a home, and to enjoy our lives together.","I have three absolute essential qualities:\n\n* Has a passion for something.  I can't date someone whose only interest after work is plopping down on the couch watching TV (and no, being a \"foodie\" is not a passion)  Whether it's art, literature, playing an instrument, building model ships,playing a sport, whatever: my future girlfriend needs to have some kind of hobby that they are excited and passionate about.\n\nEdit: To clarify on the \"foodie\" thing, I don't mean people who are into cooking. I mean people who put that they're foodies on their profiles as a cliche way of saying that they like eating at restaurants. \n\n* Is into a fit lifestyle.  Fitness is very important to be, both with exercise and diet.  I would like a swolemate not only to train together, but someone who can understand the time and dedication I put into my lifestyle.\n\n* Be kind and considerate, not just to me but other people too. \n\nNon-essential, but preferred:  I do like strong, muscular women (big arms and legs please!).  I like bookworms and artsy women, and I would love someone who shares the same interests as me so that we can do things together (metal concerts, comic cons, etc.) ","&amp;gt;I am an assistant vice president at a major U.S. bank. Despite my ambition to climb the corporate ladder, I am not a workaholic and I believe that work is just a means to an end. I prefer spending my weeknights and weekends doing what I love:\n\nHere's my controversial opinion: opening up with your career is a boring move. Everyone does it, and unless you *define* yourself by your job, it just leaves me yawning. Following it with the fact that you *don't* worship your job just leaves me asking \"so what?\" by the end. \n\nHere's some more concrete advice: use action language, not \"to be\" language. It will empower your text. So instead of \"I'm an assistant VP at blah,\" say \"As an assistant VP at blah, I help ensure financial stability of your checking account ;)\" (don't make it that cheesy, but you get the idea). See how the second is more engaging, shows more about you, even makes a (lame) joke, and adds variety to your speech? \n\n&amp;gt;-Fully appreciating this golden age of television (ask me what I watch!)\n\nScrap the parenthetical. She'll do that if she's curious.\n\n&amp;gt;-Stealing my sister's dogs for walks ~~because I do not yet have one of my own~~ (don't worry, I return them before their bedtime)\n\nCut the part I labeled above.

Am I misreading this? You should clarify here.\n\n&amp;gt;I have a college degree, a career, a vehicle, a single apartment, and a passion for bad puns.\n\nIf you don't have a pun preceding \"and a passion for puns\" it loses its punch considerably. Was the angle humor here as well? You could punch it up considerably with something like this: \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\"In case you were wondering, I've got all the essentials of a grown up: a $200k degree (debt not included!), my 9-5 that pays those bills, wheels (tricycles count, right?), and an overpriced apartment chosen only so I could impress you.\" \n\n\n&amp;gt;I don't have kids or crippling student loan debt.\n\nYou have a limited amount of time and space to introduce yourself and this is what you lead with? The kids thing is another obvious fact from the right column. The debt thing doesn't tell me anything about you, except maybe that you had an easy life. Did you pay off the debt yourself? Tell me about that. Did your parents or a benefactor? Share about how they mean a lot to you or something. \n\n&amp;gt;I am looking for a women to enjoy movies, tv show binge watch marathons, coffee dates, late night food runs, and ultimately a happy future with together; a woman who is independent but empathetic, supportive but also knows when to challenge and push for what she deserves, and whose end goal playing this manic dating game is to find a true partner. Most importantly, I am seeking someone who wants their other half to help them be who they are meant to be, without reservation or judgement, and who will provide the same for me.\n\nHere's the thing, I'm looking for all the exact same things in a woman. But if you want someone of that caliber, you have to \"put out\" that you're also capable of providing those qualities *to her*. Your profile doesn't (yet) display those qualities, so it comes across as somewhat demanding/overly picky to list these all out. \n\nYou want independence and empathy? Show more of that than \"I walk dogs and don't have debt.\" Show us how you push yourself (not to be overly harsh, but 4x of exercise a week doesn't really cut it in my book). On the whole though, it's a sweet summary and at least you're clear about what you want. Women will appreciate that. \n\nAnd that pun thing? Add it here at the end: \"I'm also *banking* on a shared love of puns ;)\"","I don't understand some of the conclusions.\n\n&amp;gt;Men with an IQ higher than 140 are perceived as relatively less intelligent (see Fig. 4.), which can reflect an adaptation to an upper intelligence limit as men with an extremely high IQ could find such practical tasks, such as the care and protection of women and offspring, less rewarding.\n\nThis is a possible reason why women would rate men of very high IQ as less attractive. I don't see how it would cause them to rate those men as less intelligent, though. I also don't see how it could possibly explain why other men would rate them as appearing less intelligent.\n\nIt seems in general like they want to explain everything with evo psych even though the data doesn't necessarily support it.\n\nedit: [this is one of the weirdest researchgate profiles](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karel_Kleisner)","From what I have noticed out of the guys I have dated, they do not seem that concerned with a woman's merits and more so how a woman makes them feel. I am accomplished woman, but out of all the things I have career wise and out of all my talents (artistic, musical, culinary, etc.), at the end of the day, it seems what guys enjoy most is being with someone that is attractive, fun and easygoing. A guy with an attractive woman often makes him feel confident and women who are fun and easygoing make a guy enjoy his time with her. Many guys value intelligence and success in a woman, but they want more than just that from one, they want what they cannot get from people like their friends or colleagues such as emotional support, comfort, affection, etc. Sometimes, some women can lose sight of this and it can push men away.","I want someone who shares in some of the same passions that I have.

I just recently went through something like this, except it was a month long. It's hard not to get down on yourself and feel like you did something wrong, or you want to reach out to figure out what happened. The most important advice I got from friends is to move on, because you'll be miserable if dwell on scenarios of what happened so quickly. Most likely you didn't do anything wrong and it's something going on with her that had been simmering for a little while. Or if had something to do with an action of yours, it's a combo of that and other factors. It sucks a lot, but as much as it's cliche, there's plenty of fish in the sea. Take as much time as you need to grieve and go do something to distract yourself. I guarantee it'll do wonders for your mental health/emotions in the long-run.","Hey Keinous I'm sorry you're experiences are getting you down. That's a common and valid response to online dating. I also fall in like with the idea of prospective date, or the idea of the person I've had a couple dates with. \n\nIt's important to guard yourself from this. Think of a time that you've changed your opinion of a new co-worker that you've seen every day over the course of several months. The reality is that you've spend far more time with that co-worker than any reasonable person would in one or several or even ten dates. \n\nBut most of us don't have ten dates with many partners while out there looking for someone we want to be more serious with. So we make decisions based on intuitions, gut feelings, and wild leaping assumptions. Maybe you hate working on cars and she's had a shop since she was a kid. Maybe you bit her ear while you were making out and that reminded her of an ex. Maybe she realized she was not in a good place to date at all right now. There are lots of small and silly ways a budding relationship can go wrong without any real fault of your own, and you shouldn't evaluate your own worth based on whether a short term dating situation pans out.\n\nIt's hard to strike a balance between being grounded and engaged without being aloof or overextended. If you feel difficulty managing that, focus on yourself for a while and not on dating; you'll have a better time. ","Ok, so there are two things that were changed recently that people dislike:\n\nThe first one is the NAME CHANGE. So, until recently, when you registered on OkCupid, you needed an unique name, different from everyone else. About a month ago, OkCupid thought it would be good to have people use their First Name instead. So, they gave everyone a mandatory name change and had a popup asking them to change their name to their First Name, because it makes dating more personal.\n\nMany people were unhappy with this change as, due to the fact that on OkCupid you have the whole questions system, it is easier to find someone if you have their name as well, even if said person might not want to be found. This means that it would be made easier to stalk someone, the opposite of what OkCupid was saying, which is that they wanted a safer experience for women.\n\nThe second change is the messages change. Until recently, one could message anyone else without liking them, and the other person could see their message and respond without liking them either. In fact, you could even get messages from people you hid, which would be the old \"pass\". OkCupid argued that women were getting too many messages and too many of those messages were useless \"hey\" or variants. Of course, women could block those profiles, they had filters to make sure that mostly those messages they were interested in reached them and a block option as well, but anyway...\n\nTheir \"fix\" for this from OkCupid was changing the rules of the game. So, now, you can only message someone after you liked them. Of course, liking is free, so you can still message anyone. HOWEVER, your message will not be seen by the other person unless they visit your profile. But... unless they pay, they don't know who liked them... OkCupid said that people that messaged you will appear in your DoubleSwipe part of the site (which is a Tinder-lite area) much easier, so people receiving messages will need to go and swipe, like on Tinder, until they find the message. Of course, since women get many messages, it becomes a case of russian roulette. Before, the problem was the endless \"hey\"s, but now, one can't know if the message they received from someone is a \"hey\". They have to search out that profile first, which is... counter-intuitive.\n\nYou also can't delete messages anymore and once you message someone the first time, their message disappears, making it impossible for people who made a first message out of several messages or people who used a joke out of parts but making it easier to just write a \"hey\". \n\nWhile before you could judge and be judged by someone based on their messages too, now good messages are hidden behind the DoubleSwipe mechanic, meaning that the average looking people that send good messages will not make a connection as few people like average looking based on just looks. Those average and below people would make a mark with their messages, something they can't do anymore.\n\nOkCupid says that harassment messages have decreased by 70% or something. This is most likely the case because all messaging has decreased by a similar amount. ","I’ve been on OKC since 2010 and had three serious relationships come from it. I’ve had A-List almost the entire time (still am today).  This site has changed so much, I can barely recognize it anymore. They know that guys send out tons of messages and rarely ever hear back. And that we may get only 1 or 2 unsolicited messages a year.\n\nThe only good thing they did recently is crack down on a lot of the fake accounts... for now. This messaging thing is nonsense. You can’t even see messages you sent, to at least have that satisfaction of seeing “Read” with a check mark, at the bottom of the message as if it’s some kind of consultation prize for your coordinated literary efforts. So to know that unless they are one of the 6 women for the year who liked me, they won’t ever read my message.\n\nUsing this site has always felt like a job to me, answering over 1500 questions and trying to hide all the accounts which are from Manhattan (I’m from New Jersey and cannot afford the high cost of that commute anymore, after two of the three relationships being across state lines... 15 dollar bridge tolls, each way...) just to figure out what accounts to really focus my messaging on.\n\nI’m a sucker for this site, and I pay for it. It blows, hah. I’m pretty sure this is the last year I’ll bother with the site. There’s no more reason to, if all the messages I send won’t even be read.","\\*Can\\* you send a second message before getting a reply under the new system? I haven't had any mutual likes under the new system yet, so the message option isn't available for me if I've already sent a message. I can't even look through my sent messages to see if I misspelled something.","&amp;gt;The first thing I noticed is that OkCupid made a mutual \"like\" necessary to send a message. I thought this was great! \n\nThis isn't correct. \n\n&amp;gt;With the mutual like, you now know that at least the girl is mildly interested in you prior to sending a message.\n\n...but the messages sent appear on the senders profile, so if they don't at least look at your profile they don't see the message. So your sentiment on the new system seems to fit how it actually works, anyway.","The biggest change I would like to see if a \"not interested\" button which we can press when receiving a message.  There's also got to be a better way to ensure that messages get read *before* liking someone.  I've gotten way too many mutual likes where I had already sent an initial message, then they like me (presumably to read the message?), but never bother responding.  I guess they are changing their minds once reading it, or they didn't look at my profile the first time?\n\nThere's got to be a way to ensure someone reads your message *and* views your profile before they can like you.","Wow, I just reactivated myself to check things about again. So let me get this strait...once you like someone, and they haven't liked you (may be a case of haven't liked you *yet*), then you can't go back later and message unless they eventually like you. Therefore you have to message on the spot before going to the next profile, no more power swiping...and if you do message, you can't see the sent message...unless they like you back, and  message back.  I am glad I messaged a guy with a cool profile this AM -I had no idea once you liked the profile they were gone for good if they hadn't liked you yet. One thing about it is, I am not butt hurt wondering if he will see it...he will when he is swiping. If he doesn't respond I am not going to blame it on OKC, just me.  \n\n\nLike it or not (I am thinking \"not\")I have to say this will definitely change my behavior. If I see someone I REALLY like I sure as heck will send a message. Maybe this is what they really want? Women to initiate more messages...\n\n","They can see they received a message, it increases the chance they stumble onto your profile in double take, then they can read your message on your profile.\n\nIt's very common for mutual likes to not reply to messages both in the old and new system. I wouldn't send a second message to someone who hasn't replied to my first, but go for it if you really want to.","I know some people are tired of seeing complaints about the new messaging system, but personally, I'm still tired of the new messaging system, so I'm going to keep complaining until they fix it.\n\nI honestly don't know what I'm supposed to do. Do I hit the like button and then wait for them to like me back? Do I send a message before I get a mutual like? If so, what's the point of having likes? And when will they see the message? If I have to send a message to every woman I like just for a *chance* at getting seen, that's a huge time commitment.\n\nIt's extremely unintuitive, unfriendly, and generally a bad experience all around. I'm a UX designer, and this shit should have never gotten past the brainstorming phase. I understand the need to protect people from hostile harassing shitheads, but they've broken the site just to prevent bad behavior by a small minority of users. (And what was wrong with *reporting* abusive users?)","I have been sitting here for the past 45m trying to figure out wtf happened to the message I sent this morning.\n\nI think it was a message, it might have been a comment. As soon as I hit send her profile disappeared, I have no sent messages tab. Did I get immediately blocked? Is there a bug? Hell, I just saw a post about shadow bans on OKC, is that what happened to me? \n\nI've been on and off this site with the same profile since 2007.  This is the first time I've returned and am completely baffled by how this is supposed to work. \n\nApparently 'passing' is now 'hiding' but not really. I'm totally fine with the 'only message mutual likes' change, actually, but tell me that in the UI somehow. \n\nI've been away for about 9 months, and this is just absolutely awful. \n\nUpdate: Ok, I finally found her profile again, so I guess they intentionally hide it until the other person likes you back? if they do? I really wished they'd made this clearer in the UI. I sent a stupid one-liner that I was literally going to follow up with something longer. Literally, \"Really, c'mon, no one folds fitted sheets anyway.\" as a comment on one of the boxes.  I was then gonna hit message to write out something more thoughtful. \n\nTotally OK that it's not seen until mutual like, but seriously, would have been better to know hitting send was a one way ticket to never getting a second sentence.","I deleted my profile, but before I did I saw messages from men I had not liked, and even ones I had passed on. The messages showed up when going through profiles in quick match, not the inbox which is reserved for mutual likes. I believe you also get an alert that someone liked you, with a prompt to start swiping to see who. Also as soon as you send a message it goes towards the front of the users cue. If someone is even remotely interested in dating and logging on, they will see the message. \n\n","As a native San Diegan now uprooted, I feel an unusual amount of duty to give you tough love, because I think you have lots of potential, but it's being wasted. \n\nMike: You're a (quite) handsome tall dude, but your photos don't show that at all. They're terrible. Your profile pic is dark and far away, and the very next pic is of the exact same scene. 2 of your photos are of caterpillars... nobody is interested in looking at those on a first impression.  You can *significantly* improve everything by just looking up a wikihow on taking a good selfie, following the instructions, and then making that your profile pic.  In an ideal world, you'd have a good photo that was just taken organically, but a quality selfie is still leagues better than what you've got so far. \n\nI like your self-summary. It makes me want to cuddle with you (no homo, I mean this only in the manliest of ways two men could share). As a side note, we should be friends. \n\nThat said, the summary is a little long. Scrap the data-driven section. Move the \"looking for\" paragraph to the \"message me if\" section. \n\n**What I'm doing with my life**\n\n&amp;gt;TL;DR: getting my shit together.\n\nNo. Don't be a project. Be a success story. Get rid of this. If you're actually getting your shit together, phrase it in a way that shows you're growing, but you already accept yourself. As it is, it comes across as self-deprecating in a not-so-flattering way. \n\nThe rest reads as an long auto-biography with no end in sight. You have some admirable life events, but they're buried in sad details nobody will want to read (except me, because I've decided I love you and want to see you succeed). \n\nCut it *way* down, and just focus on the uplifting components. You want your reader to feel good, not sorry for you. Talk about how you're taking care of your grandma because you love her. Mention how carpentry fills your creativity needs, and you've undertaken psychiatry because you like to help people. You can do that in 3-4 sentences without the sad accompanying story. \n\n**I'm really good at**\n\nYou've taken an opportunity to brag and turned it into a way to insult yourself. If you were trying for humor, it read as a more sincere self-deprecation. Is that *really* all you're good at? Why would you tell the future love of your life that all you have to offer her is pedantic messages? Don't you want to craft things for her? Care for her? Cuddle and talk late into the night with her? Find a way to brag about *that* stuff. \n\n**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food** \n\nNobody will want to read this essay. I don't even want to read what *I've* written for mine, and mine is super short. TBH this section is terrible on OkC. It's (in theory) a great opportunity to find things in common, but it's often misused and turned into a boring laundry list or life story. You've opted for the latter.  For example, turn this: \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;I do not watch many movies but the Marvel properties, especially Deadpool, Captain America, and anything involving Black Widow, are awesome. Wonder Woman is about the only thing I like from DC and, unless they bring that director back for more movies, I expect it to stay that way.\n \nInto \"I'm a big fan of superhero movies.\" Same message, less reader fatigue. \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;My current favorite show is Forged In Fire, of which I cannot say enough good things; the judges are all hilarious characters and it is awesome to watch smiths work their trade. Others shows I have enjoyed include White Collar, Burn Notice, House, Sherlock, Doctor Who, CSI, NCIS, Covert Affairs, Suits, Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU, and all manner of anime (bonus points for anyone familiar with Aria). Game of Thrones is fun to watch with friends and alcohol but recent seasons have lost me a bit.\n\n\"Forged in Fire: all time fave right now, but I'm also really into crime/mystery television. Just waiting for that Season 5 of Sherlock.\" Write it in your own voice, but you get the idea. \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;My favorite places to eat are, in no particular order, Rita's Mexican Food in El Cajon, Himalaya in La Mesa, Tender Greens in UTC, and Extraordinary Desserts next to Balboa Park. I generally prefer pork and chicken over beef, though I am partial roasts and the very occasional steak.\n\nYou failed to mention Roberto's so I disown you as a child ;). In any case, either don't list this at all, or find a more interesting way to do so. From my experience, listing personal facts is just plain boring, which is why I think most people suffer so much on this section. \"I like X over Y\" is the least interesting way to say anything, and nobody will care. Even now I'm not sure why anyone would want to know why you like pork and chicken over beef. That should just be a fact that happens in the organic way of discovery. If you feel strongly about it, say something like \"I'm working on a gofundme to scientifically prove what I already know to be true: chicken and pork are the superior meats.\" \n\n**Six things I could never do without**\n\nAnother section I see lots of people over-write in. Don't list your phone as a necessary thing, unless you want to make it funnier (like, \"I need to have GrubHub near me at all times\"). Don't include \"a vehicle.\" Literally everyone in Southern California can't live without a vehicle because everything is at least 10 miles away from everything else. The rest are ok... but you add lots of personal details that don't add to your character in a meaningful way. \n\n**I spend a lot of time thinking about**\n\nBe specific not generic here. \"Politics\" is a category on a CNN tab. \"How on earth Trump still has a working phone that's connected to the internet\" is an interesting, engaging thought. You also spelled \"rational\" wrong here, which is probably the worst place to make that kind of mistake :/. \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Stupid Songs\n\nInstead of what you wrote, why not say something like \"how to get those damn repeat songs out of my head\" (or name an annoying song). Show, don't tell. \n\n**On a typical Friday night I am**\n\nYou don't have to fill this out. If all you're doing is something that doesn't add to your strengths, don't include it. Personally, as a fellow introvert, I take the opportunity to make it clear I like quality-time and intimate settings. \n\n**The most private thing I'm willing to admit**\n\nCharlie Brown is not sexy or attractive. Openness and humility are, but your admission goes *way* too far on both accounts. Leave this section blank or admit to something else. \n\n**You should message me if**\n\nGet rid of what you have and move that paragraph from above to down here. \n\n&amp;gt;I am honestly at a loss for what to do with OKC at this point. It is clear to me that I do not know how to handle this online dating thing and I not getting better as I age. I am open to any and all insights, particularly from those willing to engage and answer questions.\n\nHey man, first of all: online dating sucks. It's just terrible, and I hate it. But second of all, getting \"good at it\" in my experience requires building self-confidence, a voice, and (unfortunately) learning what makes the best profiles. There's lots of articles out there as to what will help. It sounds like \"gaming the system\" at first, but once you realize it's just advice used to help show your *best* self (the person you already are), it's worth reading up on. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy takeaways (in case you aren't interested in reading my entire dissertation on your feedback ;)): \n\n1. Show more, tell less. You're just listing lots of facts. That doesn't grip people. \n2. Buck up and present yourself more positively. If you can't do that, work on yourself first and then come back to online dating. People like being around people that make them feel good. Nobody wants to be around someone who conveys a \"feel sorry for me\" vibe. \n3. Get better pictures of yourself. You have a dog and a handsome face. You should be acing this section. ","&amp;gt;I am an assistant vice president at a major U.S. bank. Despite my ambition to climb the corporate ladder, I am not a workaholic and I believe that work is just a means to an end. I prefer spending my weeknights and weekends doing what I love:\n\nHere's my controversial opinion: opening up with your career is a boring move. Everyone does it, and unless you *define* yourself by your job, it just leaves me yawning. Following it with the fact that you *don't* worship your job just leaves me asking \"so what?\" by the end. \n\nHere's some more concrete advice: use action language, not \"to be\" language. It will empower your text. So instead of \"I'm an assistant VP at blah,\" say \"As an assistant VP at blah, I help ensure financial stability of your checking account ;)\" (don't make it that cheesy, but you get the idea). See how the second is more engaging, shows more about you, even makes a (lame) joke, and adds variety to your speech? \n\n&amp;gt;-Fully appreciating this golden age of television (ask me what I watch!)\n\nScrap the parenthetical. She'll do that if she's curious.\n\n&amp;gt;-Stealing my sister's dogs for walks ~~because I do not yet have one of my own~~ (don't worry, I return them before their bedtime)\n\nCut the part I labeled above. The parenthetical could probably use a little work to make the joke land. \n\n&amp;gt;-Seeking out new and unique craft beers, and visiting breweries and wineries whenever I visit someplace new \n\nHang on... you just said above that you usually hit the same places with your friends. Am I misreading this? You should clarify here.\n\n&amp;gt;I have a college degree, a career, a vehicle, a single apartment, and a passion for bad puns.\n\nIf you don't have a pun preceding \"and a passion for puns\" it loses its punch considerably. Was the angle humor here as well? You could punch it up considerably with something like this: \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\"In case you were wondering, I've got all the essentials of a grown up: a $200k degree (debt not included!), my 9-5 that pays those bills, wheels (tricycles count, right?), and an overpriced apartment chosen only so I could impress you.\" \n\n\n&amp;gt;I don't have kids or crippling student loan debt.\n\nYou have a limited amount of time and space to introduce yourself and this is what you lead with? The kids thing is another obvious fact from the right column. The debt thing doesn't tell me anything about you, except maybe that you had an easy life. Did you pay off the debt yourself? Tell me about that. Did your parents or a benefactor? Share about how they mean a lot to you or something. \n\n&amp;gt;I am looking for a women to enjoy movies, tv show binge watch marathons, coffee dates, late night food runs, and ultimately a happy future with together; a woman who is independent but empathetic, supportive but also knows when to challenge and push for what she deserves, and whose end goal playing this manic dating game is to find a true partner. Most importantly, I am seeking someone who wants their other half to help them be who they are meant to be, without reservation or judgement, and who will provide the same for me.\n\nHere's the thing, I'm looking for all the exact same things in a woman. But if you want someone of that caliber, you have to \"put out\" that you're also capable of providing those qualities *to her*. Your profile doesn't (yet) display those qualities, so it comes across as somewhat demanding/overly picky to list these all out. \n\nYou want independence and empathy? Show more of that than \"I walk dogs and don't have debt.\" Show us how you push yourself (not to be overly harsh, but 4x of exercise a week doesn't really cut it in my book). On the whole though, it's a sweet summary and at least you're clear about what you want. Women will appreciate that. \n\nAnd that pun thing? Add it here at the end: \"I'm also *banking* on a shared love of puns ;)\"","&amp;gt; SHOW INTEREST. It seems like a no-brainer, but apparently that’s not the case. It’s insane how few guys even initiate conversation or try at all in the beginning. It’s like they figure there’s always something better around the corner, so whatever. Either pursue me and make your intentions clear or get away from me.\n\nI don't want to say anything unless I feel you'll react positively to it, plus I don't automatically assume that women being nice to me are into me, so I keep my mouth shut for fear of looking like an idiot. And the whole \"chase me\" thing is a stupid game you can't win. Stop chasing someone, \"you're boring and not willing to fight for what you want, go away!\" Keep chasing someone, \"no means no, asshole, this is harassment, go away!\" I will agree with you on making your intentions clear from the start - hanging around someone and hoping they'll read your mind and feel the same way is a recipe for disaster - but it works both ways.\n\n&amp;gt; TALK TO ME. Have an actual, legitimate conversation with me. Get to know me. Make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. Don’t send me two texts and then ghost. I don’t want to waste another minute of my time on something that’s going absolutely nowhere. Either act interested or don’t bother in the first place.\n\nI don't want to waste my time either. I don't want to invest in anyone unless I feel like it'll actually go somewhere. I can ask you the deepest philosophical questions there are, but if all you give me are curt, one-word answers then I assume you're not interested.\n\n&amp;gt; CALL ME. No one calls anyone anymore, and it drives me insane. If you’re trying to ask someone out, you should call that person. End of story. I don’t want to be asked out over text, or even worse, online. That means you didn’t even make the effort to get my phone number.\n\n I can't read your mind to figure out how *you* want to be asked out. Plus times have changed, this is the era of texting and apps, maybe you should lower your standards and join the rest of us in the 21st century.\n\n&amp;gt; ASK ME OUT. For real. Over the phone. On a date. Don’t ask me to hang out, or chill, or whatever people are saying these days. I’m not that girl. I want someone who appreciates me as a person and wants to take me on a real date. If you’re too lazy to do so, then lose my number. I don’t need you to take me somewhere fancy, but at least put some thought into it.\n\nSee previous.\n\n&amp;gt; SHUT UP ABOUT YOURSELF. You finally get to a first date, and he spends the entire time jabbering away about his own life and problems. I didn’t sign up to be your therapist, dude. Reality check: this doesn’t show how open and vulnerable you are. It shows how narcissistic, self-absorbed, and insecure you are. I want to get to know you, obviously, but we’re never going to work out if you don’t spend some time listening to me, too.\n\nYou want me to, as per point 2, have an actual, legitimate conversation with you, get to know you, make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. So you want me to ask all about you, but you don't want to ask at all about me? A conversation takes two people, lady, and you're presumably trying to find out about me just as much as I'm trying to find out about you. Maybe you should shut up for a while and learn about me. Just because I reveal things about myself doesn't mean I think you're my therapist.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW SOME RESPECT. I am a strong and independent woman. I don’t want a guy to be intimidated by me. I do want a man to respect me as an equal and treat me as such. My independence definitely doesn’t mean you get to abandon your manners and courtesy. I want someone who still opens doors, pulls out chairs, and gets up on the subway to give an older person his seat. No respect, no date.\n\nYou're \"strong\" and \"independent\" and \"want a man to respect me as an equal\", but you still want me to open doors for you, pull out your chair for you, etc? So you want me to treat you like a dainty flower that can't do anything for herself. Or you want me to treat you like royalty. That's not equality either way, that's treating you with exceptionalism. I'd respect you more if you could at least admit that.\n\n&amp;gt; THINK OF INTERESTING DATES. If you’ve actually talked to me and taken some time to get to know what I like, you can do better than the overdone \"dinner and a movie\" date. If you haven’t, I don’t want to go out with you anyway. When I plan our dates, I’m going to be creative, and I expect the same from you.\n\nI'm sure there are better date ideas than dinner and a movie, but I also don't want to date someone that expects to be impressed with something novel each time. All I'm hearing from this point is \"entertain me\". And you talk about when you plan dates, but I've got a feeling that you actually expect *me* to do all the planning and setting up the arrangements. This makes you sound very high maintenance, and I personally am not into that.\n\n&amp;gt; COMPLIMENT ME. Strong, independent women still want to be complimented. Every woman likes hearing that she’s pretty, funny, intelligent, and wonderful. This problem baffles me more than anything else. It’s so easy to pay a compliment, and yet most men simply don’t bother. WTF?\n\nI have no objections to this one.\n\n&amp;gt; TREAT ME WELL. I will treat you well, but I want to know that you’ll do the same as well. I’ve been in too many situations where I was a great girlfriend to a terrible boyfriend. I’m wary of going there again, so sorry — you’re going to have to prove yourself.\n\nI question how \"great\" a girlfriend you were and how \"terrible\" your boyfriends were given how narcissistic you sound so far, but it's a common enough feeling that I'll take your word for it. It boils down to the conundrum with dating in general - neither of us wants to invest in the other until we're sure the other won't disappoint us. I expect you to prove yourself to me just as much as you expect me to prove myself to you. At some point we're going to have to trust each other, otherwise one of us is moving on.\n\n&amp;gt; CONSIDER MY FEELINGS. Yes, this is a component of a mature relationship. You have to think about someone besides yourself. You can’t just make whatever decision you want without thinking about whether it might hurt me. This means you need to tell me if you’re seeing other people, and you can’t just spout insensitive crap out of your mouth. All I ask is that you’re a considerate human being.\n\nAre you going to consider my feelings in return? And if I accidentally say something you perceive as insensitive, are you going to let me know so that I can learn not to say it again? Or are you going to go cold on me and not communicate with me?\n\n&amp;gt; UNDERSTAND THAT I’M WORTH IT. I can’t date any more men who don’t put in any effort. I know that I’m worthy of a great guy, and it drives me crazy that so many jerks don’t see it. Obviously they aren’t the right men for me, but I’m so tired of waiting around for one who is. When is someone going to man up and decide he wants me for his own?\n\nSo far you seem to define \"effort\" as \"someone who will show their entire hand to me without seeing any of my cards\". You want a guy to pursue you, treat you like a queen, and act completely invested in you, all without any show of promise that you'll do likewise for them. Maybe you keep dating men who don't appear to put in any effort because you're not putting in any effort? It's a two-way street, lady.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW ME YOU CARE. I’m pretty chill, but don’t treat me like one of your bros. Make at least little gestures to show that you’re interested and that you appreciate me as a person. It can be as small as a sweet, lingering kiss or brushing my hair away from my face. Just some little way of showing you care is always appreciated.\n\nEveryone expresses their love and affection in different ways. Either learn to recognize someone's style, or just ask them for the type of affection that you want. And why would I give someone I just met a lingering kiss or brush their hair away? That's getting too far into someone's personal space too soon. It takes time to build that sort of affection and trust.\n\n&amp;gt; TRY YOUR BEST. I’m not asking for perfection here. Just make a little effort, and I’ll be happy. What drives me insane are all the guys who simply don’t try at all. It’s extremely upsetting and frustrating. I’m starting to feel like it’s me, but I refuse to lower my standards just because men don’t seem to be capable of meeting them.\n\nI somehow doubt you're not looking for perfection, or that you'd actually be satisfied with someone putting in a \"little\" effort. But at least you've got some self-awareness.\n\n&amp;gt; CHALLENGE ME. Talk to me. Ask me deep questions. Find out what makes me tick. I want to connect on a deeper level, and I want someone who is all about doing that, too. Help make me want to be the best I can be every single day. There’s no point for me to bring another person into my life unless we’re going to benefit each other.\n\nThis is just a rehash of a few of the above points and requires no further rebuttal.\n\n&amp;gt; CONNECT WITH ME. I’m not looking for some surface BS, so if that’s all you want, let me know upfront. Don’t try to trick me into thinking you want more so you can get laid. I’m so done with that sneaky, dishonest behavior. Either put effort into what we have, or don’t even bother starting anything with me.\n\nSee previous.\n\nMost of this can be condensed into \"I don't want to invest in someone unless they've invested in me\". Fair enough, I'm sure it's a universal condition, but the entire thing as worded comes off as entitled. The only line it was missing was \"are there any good men out there still?\"\n\ntldr; I put way too much effort into this.","&amp;gt;Anyway, I'm crying way more than I expected but it could be the alcohol\n\nFrom experience, booze really brings me down. It's not that it makes our feelings invalid, it just makes it hard to take on an optimistic counter-view when things are hard. I recommend staying away from alcohol for a few days after a breakup to recalibrate. \n\n&amp;gt;I just can't help but feel like something is wrong with me even though I know that I'm a fucking catch for someone who's like willing to stick around.\n\nIt's actually a deep-set biological reaction to feel this way. The emotion, shame, is hard-wired in us when we get rejected because it instills a desire to maintain part of the community. Back in the days when being out of the tribe meant being a lion snack, this was a very useful driver. These days, it just colors our worldview and self-perception to make us feel unlovable (even when we rationally know this is false). \n\nOne trick I've learned: When you feel unlovable, acknowledge the feeling (don't push back on it), recognize it's *just* a feeling (caused by our biology) &amp;amp; doesn't mean anything real, and then remember that basically everyone goes through that same feeling at some point or another. Try to visualize the brighter days when you'll look back on this moment and think *Damn, that was rough, but it's so much better now.*\n\n&amp;gt;I have a hard time connecting with people, I know this. \n\nI don't know your history or life experience, but as someone who grew up in a terrible home with lots of abandonment issues, defaulting to this mindset comes naturally. However, I don't think it's actually a true belief. If you're an empathetic person, you have passions and thoughts and interests in the world, I don't believe you can't connect with others (even if it feels that way). \n\n&amp;gt;Fam, I need a hug.\n\n*hugs* Just remember there are people right now who you've never even met, and still care deeply about your well-being and happiness, and accept you just the way you are.  \n\n\nNB: This sounds super hippie-dippie, but as someone who registers \"very skeptical\" on the rational/emotional thinking spectrum, I've actually found that [Metta exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett%C4%81) do wonders after a tough breakup. ","If you see successful profiles of men your age you'd see the following:\n\n* They work out. Your post history indicates you refuse to get in better shape. \n\n* They have good pictures. Quite honestly, your pictures on your profile are pretty boring. Your main picture is in front of a parking lot, the second picture is a selfie with a kind of creepy looking smile (this has nothing to do with your teeth, it just looks kinda forced), I spent more time looking at the plant in your third picture than you, the fourth picture is fine honestly, although the lighting is really dark and the setting's a bit odd. The fifth picture.. you're the least attractive guy in the picture, your belly is showing pretty prominently, and you're the only one not directly looking into the camera, while the other two guys are.  I say none of this to be mean, just being honest about what I took away.  Honestly, I too have a pretty creepy looking smile, when I force a smile it looks awful. So I either use candid pictures where I was smiling, or smile with my mouth closed (like you do in your first picture). For reference, here are mine: https://imgur.com/a/i7iQi The bike and t-rex pictures usually make girls laugh and are good conversation starters, and the Mario one is another silly one. I honestly think your first picture would be a solid profile picture if it had a more interesting background that caught people's attention, you look good in the picture.  So a couple silly pictures wouldn't hurt your cause and would show you're a fun guy. If you're not willing to work out and get in shape, you're gonna have to spice up your profile a bit. The first thing people see are your appearance and your photos, so those need to be fixed before anything. Great photos + a meh profile will always be more successful than a great profile with meh photos.\n\n* A profile that's both descriptive and playful. Your profile does read almost like a resume, rather than with personality.  It's very matter of fact and doesn't really say much about you other than that you work in finance and like reading. It could use one or two playful quips throughout it to inject a little humor. Your first paragraph reads really well to be quite honest, though I think the second sentence is kind of blah. You're looking for an intelligent, ambitious woman who feels her work is important to the greater good. So is EVERYONE ELSE. I personally think sentences that say \"I'm looking for a woman that's X\" just don't serve much purpose unless they're based around a specific lifestyle (i.e. fitness-centric). I would leave out the \"My friends tell me I'm a very good listener and I'd like to hear what you've read lately\". Instead, put together a list of descriptors about yourself.  An example on my profile: \"I'm a full-blown utlitarian, a feminist, an affectionate extrovert, a loyal friend, and a comma whore.\" There's a little playful quip at the end, but I basically described a lot of my personality with that list. Try to put together a list of things you know are true about yourself. If you're not going to list a lot of your hobbies (I usually don't on my profile), at least give a very strong picture of who you are as a person. Also, definitely include that you took up salsa dancing. That's a pretty adventurous hobby and will take a lot of women by surprise. Girls consistently write about adventure on their profiles and want someone who's exciting. You can phrase it like \"I'm adventurous and enjoy trying new things. In fact, I recently took up salsa dancing.\" \n\nHopefully this helps.  I didn't want to post my entire profile, because I don't think copying what I do on my profile would be very authentic. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.\n","phrases like \"just trying to get by\" and \"some people might call me naive\" and \"not the easiest to earn\" come across as negative. it's not that they're terrible phrases or anything but the tone you set changes how other stuff reads. i would find a better way to phrase these or just remove them altogether\n\nin general you come across as very stiff. if that's who you are, that's fine, but if you think you're a fun or funny person, try to punch it up a little.\n\n&amp;gt;I have a wide range of hobbies that go from being a gamer, to Dungeons and Dragons, to singing, and even to writing and reading.\n\nso this is super nitpicky but dungeons and dragons is a game. so it doesn't really make sense to say \"hobbies range from gaming to dungeons and dragons\"\n\nalso nitpicky but I feel like the phrasing is just awkward? usually with this structure you would say something like \"ranges from X to Y\" and stop your list there.\n\nfor both of these reasons, and because the hobbies are not that diverse anyway, you could just change it to \"my hobbies include x, y, z, w, and r\" instead. or something more punched up if you want but you get the idea.\n\n&amp;gt;I'm here looking for someone who can take life day by day while keeping a clear head and an honest outlook on life. That isn't to say a positive or negative one, just someone honest, earnest, and not afraid to do the right thing.\n\nimo this comes across as if you feel that you have these qualities and that other people generally don't. the words themselves are not negative but it has a sort of air to it that feels judgmental. basically i read this and i think \"this person is going to expect me to think just like him, and be upset and mean about it if i don't.\"\n\n&amp;gt;I guess some people might call me naive, but I just like to think I have some integrity to me. I always try to do what's right by me and by others, and I can assure you that my loyalty, while not the easiest to earn, is unfaltering.\n\nbasically the same thing as above. i don't think either of these sections really help you at all.\n\nin general traits like loyalty, honesty, and integrity are not really things you want to emphasize. it's not that they're bad things, obviously, but they're things that we just assume you have (or, think you have). it also is just generally not great to list positive traits you have, since there's no reason we should believe you. ie if you're funny, say things that make me laugh, don't just say you're funny. \n\n&amp;gt;I love to travel and to experience new things. If you bring something new to the table, you can bet I'll probably give it a shot at least once (unless it's illegal, I try to avoid that kind of stuff).\n\njust drop the illegal part, otherwise fine\n\n&amp;gt;Anyways, there's a lot to me that I can't put into words off the top of my head, so go ahead and send me a message. I can't see likes, and I'd love to get to know you! I hope you have a great day.\n\ndrop the \"i can't see likes\" part","This was not a good week dating/relationship wise.\n\nFirst off, a geek-themed speed dating event scheduled yesterday was canceled due to low numbers, and the organizer said that she probably wouldn’t schedule another event.  I’m so bummed out because it probably would have been a good chance to find people who are into fandoms like me.  Plus, the first event they had back in April I had to miss due to it being scheduled the same night as Infinity War.  Now I really regret seeing the movie instead of going to the event.\n\nMy old FWB came into town.  When we first met while she was living here getting treatment for Lupus last year, we had the most amazing chemistry, and the intimacy we shared was incredible.  I was so excited to see her.  However, she seemed kind of out of it the two times we hung out.  The first night, we cuddled, but didn’t have sex because she said she was cramping really bad due to an IUD she had put in.  \n\nThe second day, when I picked her up, she looked very out of it, and she told me she was very stoned.  She said she smoked as much as she did for her joint pain, but it was very hard to converse with her.  We had dinner and ice cream, and then we went back to my place where she laid down on the couch watching Rouge One, not really wanting to cuddle or anything like that.  Finally, we get to the bedroom, and cuddle for a bit before she tells me that she wasn’t in the mood again for anything further.  She said ever since she got the IUD, her libido tanked (a far contrast from when she lived here last year when she always wanted to jump my bones).  She said she was sorry for feeling awful and being so out of it, but I felt crushed.  I asked her if it had anything to do with me, and she insisted it was nothing I did.\n\nWith everything that has happened dating wise over the past few months: getting stood up, getting flaked, getting led on, getting hurt over and over again, I kind of broke down.  I’m 99% positive she’s being honest with me, but after my past experiences with other women hurting me, I had a nagging thought that it really was me, and that I wasn’t attractive to her or desirable anymore, or that I did something that turned off her want for me.  With everything compounded, I honestly felt broken, and I haven’t felt that in awhile.\n\nMy new therapist asked me, when we were talking about dating, about maybe getting friends to set me up.  I told him that while I have a pretty good social circle, no one really knows anyone who is single and a good match for me.  Reflecting on that also hurt me even more.  It hurts even more when I feel like I am giving it the best I can to improving myself and being the best version of myself.\n\nI spent most of Saturday morning watching morbid, dark and depressing movies like Antichrist and I See the Devil, before going to the r/Vegas Meetup and hanging out with a couple friends.  Doing the latter really helped me, and while I still feel a lot of pain, it helped me at least enjoy myself for a bit.\n\nI know it sounds lame, but I really could use a kind word or some encouragement.  I feel beyond sad right now, and I can’t get these thoughts out of my head that I’m unlovable, undesirable and all that fun stuff.","You posted this about an hour ago too didn't You?\n\n\nYou come across as super american. I knew where you was from based on pictures alone, and the rest confirms it. That really doesn't work in the uk. It comes across as fake and slimey.

Tell people you play x game on Nintendo Switch and you love it because it \\&amp;lt;insert reason\\&amp;gt;.  \n\n\nDon't tell people you \"watch YouTube and Netflix\". Tell people you watch videos from x channel and you are currently watching x TV show on Netflix. Tell people you have x TV shows/movies in your queue. Tell people you the last video you saw from x channel made you want to learn more about x or that you wanted to keep watching videos about x.

It's about inviting them to get excited about the things you're excited about.","&amp;gt;lumos stuff\n\nno. this is the first thing people read, it should be the strongest part of your profile. this is just weird\n\n&amp;gt;geekiest, most boring, and most average guy you'll ever meet\n\nself-deprecation is fine in small doses if it's funny but this isn't, so it just sounds like you're down on yourself. it also doesn't make sense to say you're the \"geekiest\" and \"most average\" since those contradict each other. likewise, \"boring\" and \"geeky\" don't really go together, since presumably being geeky means you're into interesting things (or at least things that are interesting to you).\n\n&amp;gt;i'm a big believer in being direct\n\nwhile I see why this sounds good in your head, most people who say things like this are assholes who claim that they're just \"being honest\" when really they just have no tact or empathy. not saying you are, but that's how it reads.\n\n&amp;gt;work and hobby stuff\n\nthis is boring but that's fine, it's pertinent information. there's another section for \"what i'm doing with my life\" but not too important.\n\n&amp;gt;games stuff\n\nlike the above there's a section for listing the media you like. in this case i would actually move it to a different section because being a gamer is sometimes frowned on. you shouldn't hide it but when you lead with it it gives off a vibe you may not want. ie you can present yourself as a \"gamer\" or \"someone who plays games.\" up to you though.\n\nthe \"by the goddess\" line is too obscure of a reference. think of how this reads to someone who never played mass effect or doesn't remember it well enough to know what this is\n\n&amp;gt;current goal\n\ndon't be down on yourself. if you can't find a way to spin your life positively, just don't fill this section out.\n\n&amp;gt;i could probably beat you at\n\ndon't be down on yourself!\n\nthe rest of it is just kind of sparsely filled out and generally there isn't much to say about it. I don't really get any sense of who you are from anything you've written, other than that you think you're boring.\n\nfocus on the things you like, the things that interest you, the things that make you interesting. it's perfectly fine to be boring most of the time, most people are and we all know that. you want to present the sides of you that are exciting and fun and make someone want to be with you, and I can see hints of that in your profile. you play tennis, you do krav maga, you cook. so bring that stuff out! talk about what you like to cook, why you do krav, why you like sitcoms from the 90's.","I've been in a weird funk the last month or two. I thought it was just my job, and some of the things I don't like about the culture of my company, so I turned on LinkedIn and started talking to recruiters. Then I thought it might be breaking up with the Canadian, so I went on a date that ended up being one of the worst ones of all time I have had.  \n\nBut last weekend, while I was talking to my friends in Austin during the post-wedding bar crawl, I decided I am not just bored with my company, I am bored with myself. I am unhappy with my weight, with how little I go out and do things, with how much I binge drink, with how I am half-assing work, with how little discipline I have for fitness and reading and cleaning even though have all the free time in the world. I don't need to double down on work or dating, I need to double down on myself (as super corny as that sounds). So I came home a day early from Austin, cut off my hair, turned off every dating app, cancelled all of my interviews, and started a game plan. Something about cutting my hair off especially seemed to help immediately and make me feel back to myself. It felt like having pretty long hair was a mask, I am a brassy badass with no filter not a floaty boho mermaid. I picked out goal clothes and have all of my keto chow - I am still struggling with the fitness part because of weather things, but I am working on ending my excuses around that. \n\nSo here goes nothing, I guess. We'll see how long this determination phase lasts, but three days of strict keto in, I am already feeling a little better. Though that could be the vitamin D supplements talking. ","Finally about to be home for a week with no travel. SO excited about being able to just be for a bit before the rest of June jets me somewhere every week until mid-July. \n\nStill feeling really really good about turning off all of my interviews and focusing on what I have now and myself. I even signed up for a 30 day shred challenge at my UFC gym, and I am really excited about it. All of my dating apps are still off, I find myself completely uninterested in dating and find no reason to turn them back on until I feel ready. \n\nInstead of New Year Resolutions, I have micro-goals tied to a word each month. Looking back as May ends, it was definitely one of my more successful months - tied to the word Home. I renewed my lease, started to nest, bought new rugs and new towels and new duvet colors. Decided on a color scheme. Chilled on my roof. And I am finally starting to get out in NYC and enjoy the city itself. June is Mind, and I am really looking forward to reading some of the books I have been procrastinating on during my travels, and some of the other goals I set. \n\nHope everyone is having a great Memorial Day weekend!","All things considered, I had my first really good week of this year. I had some triumphs at work, went to boxing several times to the point I got a nickname because they caught me dancing at the bag before class, went for my first outdoor run in two months, and stayed relatively on course with strict keto. I was even social twice yesterday, which is kind of big for me lately. Almost a year after moving here, I finally feel like I am mentally settling in.    \n\nSo I turned on all my dating apps, and while I was watching Sex and the City last night, and Carrie was cuddling Big, I realized I am truly ready to pursue that again. Even if it isn't a serious relationship, just that kind of connection with someone.   \n\nI am going to dip my toe in this week since it is the dreaded Valentine's Day, and because I am going out of town the following week, but I am finally feeling ready to get back out there. And that feels really good. ","Even though work was fucking insane this week (damn sandbox refreshes erasing my damn POCs), I had a great week over all. I ate pretty strict keto, I decided to take Mattie to the grass dog run a couple times instead of drinking, even when I was tipsy on Friday I poured a big glass of tequila but didn't drink it. I went to boxing and sent out my laundry to be done for the first time. Cleaned my house yesterday and went for a long run today. \n\nIt feels like my healthy habits are finally being established. Which made me want to go back on Bumble and swipe around, but then I realized I only have one pic of my new do, and I don't want to be hair-fishing. \n\nSoooo, instead I am going to the movies and used book shopping today, and then focusing on the shred challenge this week. \n\nIt's probably for the best. ","I'm with you. Ex of 3 years broke up with me back in october and moved on within a month. \n\nMeanwhile I have absolutely 0 luck on jswipe/okc/tinder/bumble. I've turned off all my dating apps. \n\nTo keep myself from being sad, I've been coming into work earlier and staying later - from 8am to 8pm. \n\nAfter work I go to the gym (or rock climbing on my rest days) until 10pm. I come home at 11pm, shower and go to sleep. Rinse and repeat for the past ~2 months since I have no luck dating. \n\nI've also mostly lost interest in food and have been eating around 1000-1200 calories a day, sometimes less. ","I woke up next to the Canadian this week, and most of my romantic feelings for him were gone. It is just one too many times where he talked up lots of things and none of them were realized because of how he was \"tired\" or \"not good company.\" I think my brain is turned off by everything always being on his terms because he has been single so long he isn't able to factor in someone else. I also realized just how prissy he is during the date and unaffectionate in general, and we had a side conversation that makes me think he is a lot like one of my exes who may not be looking for a serious relationship ever. \n\nBut at least I came to this realization sooner than before, and I feel like I am more mature about the reckoning. I may keep dating him in a casual relationship because I have no interest in turning back on the dating apps with travel coming up, weddings, work stuff, and I am genuinely trying to lose weight and get fit and feel better about myself physically before I get back out there. I also want to spend some dedicated energy on enjoying NYC and exploring the area with my long day trip list more than I want to be swiping again. \n\nThe biggest source of my sadness actually came from earlier this week during a groupme conversation when I realized I haven't been in a defined relationship nor said I love you in seven years. But it's less sadness than a couple years ago, and I keep reminding myself that I put other things first and I am not in a rush to settle for someone just because I am lonely. I have no biological clock to worry about and I have so many good things in my life every day because I worked hard and moved around and took leaps in other areas. \n\nI think I need to plan a vacation soon, I could use some brain decluttering. ","This week was incredibly stupid. The startup I wanted to work for rejected me - I am pretty sure because the CEO and I didn't really gel during my interview, my work is being stupid as per usual, then there was drama after the wedding last weekend (my own fault for drinking manhattans when I knew I was jet lagged) and I finally just lost it last night and ended discussions about a hookup that happened because I don't have time for sadboi bullshit, then I missed a meet up because I over slept, then I was too sick to go on my cruise today to Bear Mountain. Which is probably ok because today is humid as hell anyway. I am ending this day with a face mask and a cup of peppermint tea after crossing off all my todos. \n\nI don't care if my actions to avoid the drama in DC cost me every friend in that friend group, I am finally in a point of my life where I am selfish and focusing on setting up the life I have always wanted in NYC. I am dating the gym and finding a better job and taking my dog to the dog run - I don't have enough emotional energy for anyone else's bullshit. ","The theme of my year was \"progress, not perfection\" - which sounds corny but meant a lot to me with life stuff going on and my tendency to beat up on myself all the time. \n\nHalf-way through the year, and I am finally feeling the progress. I fought hard to be back to moderation with drinking, my hair is short again so I feel like myself when I look in the mirror instead of trying to be the basic bitch I always secretly wanted to be, I am losing weight and making fitness habits, and not spending money left and right so my credit score is back up to my goal. \n\nStill a lot of ways to go, still feeling really half-hearted and hesitant to begin dating again, but since it is a really slow month with work, I am looking forward to July as a month to be a bit of a hermit and focus on myself and reflecting on what I really want from my life as I hide from the heat. ","I'm 31 and so done with all of this. At this point I've taken the free time I used to spend dating and am volunteering like crazy around my community.  Honestly I'm pretty sure I'm just going to do my thing until I'm 35 and then adopt. Unless there is an option to wake up 6 months into a relationship the dating life no longer interests me. I still want kids though.\n\nAfter a relationship I was in (also short but I was super invested in it) ended last year, I just felt done. Putting myself out there just does not feel worth the risk to me anymore. It doesn't feel constructive for me or my life, I have other things I want to accomplish in my life.  And these days I don't need to be married to have a family so fuck it.\n\nUnless someone comes and sweeps me off my feet for once (I am a guy btw) I don't have the energy to pursue anymore.","Fulfilling my wish from this morning to end the day with a face mask and peppermint tea after checking off all of my to-do list. Took a unisom hoping it will help me shake the last of my allergy infection so I can gym tomorrow. I spent the day journaling and planning - by actually addressing some of my credit card debt instead of ignoring it, it turns out I can pay it all off by next year, and that is an incredibly exciting thing though it will require a budget. \n\nNo dates, but looking forward to flying to Austin on Thursday to see my girls and party it up. Picking out my outfits is super fun.","You're obviously going to find more of either of those types of relationship than someone that has everything, that's the rub with dating. Personally, i'd rather stay patient and try to find someone with the whole package than settle for someone who's not offering physical chemistry, reliability, and excitement. Also, if you dated someone for months or years, but things fizzled out, that's still a success in the end. Don't characterize relationships that end as failures, otherwise your romantic life is going to be littered with \"failures\", and MAYBE one life-long success. \n\nFrom the sounds of it, you're not having problems getting dates, so don't settle. If you're attracted to men who are more dominant types, then stick with that, because if you don't have attraction up front, you're less likely to invest. If a guy's redeeming quality is that he's \"sweet\" or \"nice\", then he's not bringing a ton to the table probably. When we date someone, we obviously think they're nice and sweet.  Please stop going on dates with men you're not attracted to, because they'd be crushed if they ever found that out, the same as you'd be crushed if you found out a man you were on a date with wasn't extremely attracted to you.\n\nNeither a stable and boring or unstable but hot relationship is going to work out super long-term if you want someone that continuously challenges you but also makes you happy every day. I can say that with the unstable but hot relationship, at least the fun aspect is there, even if just for a short amount of time. Just don't commit to a guy that falls in either of those buckets and be patient. You're only 23. It usually takes me  50+ first dates to meet someone I REALLY think is the right fit for me. It could take years, but I'd rather wait years for the right compatible person than settle for something mediocre.","At this point, I am looking for a long-term partner. I did the casual thing for awhile, and while that was fun, I'm at the point of my life where I am focusing more on finding that right, compatible partner.\n\nProbably what changed the most is that I'm becoming a lot more picky when it comes to physical attraction. In the past, I have been in relationships with women who I weren't particularly attracted  to (my last ex fits this bill.) I always thought that personality and kindness were more important than looks, but when we both struggled with a dead bedroom, at first I thought there was something wrong with me sexually, but then I realized that it was because I was with someone who, and this sounds so shitty, I wasn't turned on by. In her case, I went out with her because I thought we had similar personalities (I was really shy and introverted back then, and while I am still that way, I have gotten out of my comfort zone significantly in the past two years.) and that as a result, we would be a good fit for each other. \n\nThe biggest constraint in my dating, at least with online dating, is that there aren't many people that I'm coming across that are my type. That's why I am focusing less on online and more with organic in-person connections. To summarize, I am looking for a geeky swolemate.","Your second sex question (Regardless of future plans, what's more important to you right now? Sex.)\n\n&amp;gt; Being honest here. My last relationship was kinda rough on me. I am seeking intimacy though (both conversational and sexual)\n\nSTOP BROADCASTING YOUR BAGGAGE. You wrote this on a sex question? These women don't even know you, you're telling them you just want to hook up, and you're unloading all your emotional baggage on them already? Then, you list hookups on your profile, but also say you're most likely to finish during sex via masturbation in another question. Looking at it practically, what girl wants to sign up for a hookup with an emotionally damaged man that she probably won't be able to make finish? If you're looking for a hookup, girls are probably looking at your sex questions, so please be more conscious of the ones  you're answering. Also, standard protocol for dudes that want hookups is to list \"short-term dating and new friends\" and leave hookups out. Sounds counterintuitive but think of how many women list \"no hookups\" on their profile? A lot. Because 99% of women don't want to just sleep with you once then never see you again. Listing hookups shows you're overly focused on sex and that's a turn off. \n\nI'm gonna be honest, your profile does not read as one that a woman will see and want to hook up with you on date 1. If you're broadcasting that you only want a hookup to women, there's a much higher standard you're being held to. You're not muscular/fit/in noticeably great shape and you don't really have a profile that stands out as overly funny or attention-getting. I think your profile is okay for short-term dating and new friends and I would advise you drop hookups. Also drop the \"nomadic phase which makes something long-term unlikely'. You communicate that in a much better way by not including long-term dating in your looking for.","Hey Keinous I'm sorry you're experiences are getting you down. That's a common and valid response to online dating. I also fall in like with the idea of prospective date, or the idea of the person I've had a couple dates with. \n\nIt's important to guard yourself from this. Think of a time that you've changed your opinion of a new co-worker that you've seen every day over the course of several months. The reality is that you've spend far more time with that co-worker than any reasonable person would in one or several or even ten dates. \n\nBut most of us don't have ten dates with many partners while out there looking for someone we want to be more serious with. So we make decisions based on intuitions, gut feelings, and wild leaping assumptions. Maybe you hate working on cars and she's had a shop since she was a kid. Maybe you bit her ear while you were making out and that reminded her of an ex. Maybe she realized she was not in a good place to date at all right now. There are lots of small and silly ways a budding relationship can go wrong without any real fault of your own, and you shouldn't evaluate your own worth based on whether a short term dating situation pans out.\n\nIt's hard to strike a balance between being grounded and engaged without being aloof or overextended. If you feel difficulty managing that, focus on yourself for a while and not on dating; you'll have a better time. ","The title showcased the persons bias so I will just leave that at that. \n\nTheir section on commitment really highlighted this. In any long term relationship there are going to be ups and downs. As long as people are willing to put in the work then things will get better. Marriage is one of those things that encourages people to put in the work. Almost every marriage I have heard about has hit a rough spot that could last 6 months to a year+. My dad had a rough patch that lasted for 2 between children and losing his job. But they stuck it out because they were married. Their lives were tied together with finances, children, property, etc. Now they are 10 years past that and as happy as can be. \n\nStrong relationships are tenpered from adversity IMO. Marriage is one of the things that helps it survive without cracking.  Now it is a double edged sword for bad relationships, but that is a moot arguement because they shouldn’t have gotten married in the first place. \n\nBut ask a Gay man or girlfriend who was not allowed to be with their partner as they died because they were not married. Ask someone who had to watch their partners family make decisions because they were not married. \n\nI personally think that a lot of people who get married, shouldn’t be getting married and so in that area I agree that too many people get married for the wrong reasons. However when it is a good relation, marriage is nothing but a benefit to the relationships success. However, and this is something I have noticed, is that most people want relationships to be easy. They want it to be perfect fairy tale land. They don’t want to put in the hard work to make it last. Relationships and marriage are a JOB, if that is not something you want? Then don’t get married.”","i've been in this exact relationship for three years. met her when i was 38, even! i'd never dated a mom before, or a divorcee. it can work. and yes, your lifestyles are *SUUUUPPPPPEEEEEERRRRR* incompatible. lots of compromises, mostly on your part, will be necessary -- if you're looking for something meaningful and long lasting, at least. if you're just lookin' to get busy, be upfront about that, and you'll find there are plenty of very busy single moms with no time for a \"relationship\" out there, plenty happy to receive the undivided attention of a willing partner now and again. but also know that if you're looking for that sweet sweet long term lovin', you better be on board with the whole kids thing, and not be a tool who drops in for a while and then bounces. that fucks up kids right down deep -- they don't have the capacity to understand that you're leaving their *mom*, not them. so be clear with her from the start that meeting the kids is gonna be a big step, not to be taken lightly.","* She became less physically attracted and drawn to me following a 3-month hospital stint where I lost all muscle mass. I built it all back up over a 3-month span and was in BETTER SHAPE than when we met, but that desire never returned.\n\n* She claimed she was extroverted and that physical touch was her #1 love language when we started dating. By the time we broke up, physical touch had fallen off a cliff and she revealed herself to be an introvert and wished I wouldn't focus so much on the physical aspect of our relationship.\n\n* I told her I didn't want to have kids, she was okay with that going in, and she changed her mind about 5 months in.\n\n* She refused to break her routine of 10 PM bedtime and 5 AM wakeup time to work out for anything. Period. I am not a person who follows routines and things were not that way at the start. Again, things changed.\n\nOverall I felt a real sense of complacency on her side of things. She'd had one serious relationship (a 9-year marriage), and she absolutely threw the sweat pants on right about when I got out of the hospital. Her willingness to show me love in the way I needed it and to compromise on what I needed just faded more and more over time. ","I'd say I am \"successful\" in dating. I'm a conventionally attractive 27 year old male in a pretty big metro area. I probably have two first dates a week on average. I've found that I probably meet at least 50 people before I get into a relationship. It SHOULD take a while. As I get older, I'm becoming more selective too because I know what I do and don't want more than ever before. \n\nI'm always suspicious of people who become BF/GF with the first person they meet. There are exceptions but they're generally looking for a relationship rather than looking for the right person, which is completely backwards.\n\nStay patient and don't settle for a situation that doesn't provide what you're looking for.","I see this most often when the ex happens to be the first long term gf they have. They stay longer than they intend to because they either a) don't know how to break it off OR b) they like the girl enough to stay with them for now but are too young/inexperienced to make the \"marriage\" decision.\n\nThe LTR after that usually ends up being a better fit (since they now have a better idea of what they want in a partner) and, due to their previous experience, they can more quickly discern if this person is marriage material. So I think a lot of the time it's just a timing and experience thing.","Experience not only teaches a person what they like/don't like, it makes them better equipped to provide what their partner likes or avoid what they don't like.\n\nIs there a difference between someone who was in a long-term relationship and had sex with the same person 10,000 times and someone who has had varied relationships but only had sex 1,000 times?\n\nI'd suggest that the person with varied relationships has a greater awareness of things - though in no way are either of those people inexperienced.\n\nThe whole \"inexperience = good; experienced = slut\" stuff is ridiculous in nature and extremely poor logic.","She \"broke up\" with me because I stopped responding to her texts when my phone died.  She knew it was dying; she wanted me to stop hanging out with my friends at the house (playing shots trivia) to go charge my phone.\n\nIt's worth mentioning at this point that she had gotten increasingly controlling and obsessive.  I think she had BPD, I'm not too sure, she's doing fine now.\n\nSo after having fun with my friends I want back to my dorm room, went to bed, woke up the next day to a shitton of texts and skype messages about where the fuck was I and \"we're over\"... and at that point it just hit me like \"Yeah, this is over, cool\".\n\nSo I called her and she was 100% unironically expecting me to beg for forgiveness and to get back together and I was just \"nope done\".  She insisted that I owed it to her to break up with her in person, so my buddy drove me about an hour over to her mom's place and break up with her in person I did.  What she was really trying to do is convince me to stay the night to sleep with her, which was neat and all, but my buddy drove me and had my back and soon enough we were out of there.\n\nShe went through a mini meltdown, and basically invited herself onto campus that weekend, invited herself to a party we were having, and I being non confrontational basically decided to get ahead on studying and stay out of my room and out of the house as much as possible.  That is to say, I made myself as scarce as possible.\n\nSo she's at the house all weekend making everyone different shades of uncomfortable.  A good friend of mine still relates a story where she was hitting on him and he was super confused because he didn't know we had broken up and, well, nobody ever hit on him.  I think I should have just kicked her out but I really really didn't want to deal with it -- I was hoping she'd just burn herself out trying to get attention from me and leave.\n\nFinally Sunday rolls around and she really ought to be leaving. Coincidentally I had some business at the house I needed to take care of.\n\nNaturally, there was an issue: she couldn't leave until she \"found her dress\" and I (for some reason) was supposed to help her find it.  It was hanging in some closet, where (presumably) she hid it.  So finally that's settled and she leaves.\n\nI'm finally free and able to spend time with my friends, I got a bottle of Evan Williams Green Label (the finest) to sip on, and I get a call from her.  She's in the CVS parking lot and if I don't come get her she'll take a million tylenol.  I tell her I'm coming, and to describe where she's at.  I call her mom, call the cops, chug some liquor.\n\nShe was committed for a few days iirc, and that's not even the full end of the story but I'm just going to stop it here.\n\nSorry for changing tenses halfway through, and yes I know I probably didn't handle the whole situation correctly but I was 20(?) and somehow stupider than I am today.","there was a thing about this on the radio recently\n\na guy was following IG models so his wife made a fake account and started DMing him to catch him trying to cheat on her\n\nhe sent texts to his friend saying he knew it was his wife for \"evidence,\" and then strung her along making her think he was gonna cheat to teach her a lesson\n\nso eventually she called him out and he laughed at her and showed her the texts and proved her \"wrong\" (in his mind, at least)\n\ni don't really know why i'm telling this story. i guess don't do what his wife did. or, if you do, and he does what the husband did, dump him. \n\nedit: i just noticed the name. you should dump him and then make 50 threads about it","&amp;gt;I am an assistant vice president at a major U.S. bank.

I prefer spending my weeknights and weekends doing what I love:\n\nHere's my controversial opinion: opening up with your career is a boring move. Everyone does it, and unless you *define* yourself by your job, it just leaves me yawning. Following it with the fact that you *don't* worship your job just leaves me asking \"so what?\" by the end. \n\nHere's some more concrete advice: use action language, not \"to be\" language. It will empower your text. So instead of \"I'm an assistant VP at blah,\" say \"As an assistant VP at blah, I help ensure financial stability of your checking account ;)\" (don't make it that cheesy, but you get the idea). See how the second is more engaging, shows more about you, even makes a (lame) joke, and adds variety to your speech? \n\n&amp;gt;-Fully appreciating this golden age of television (ask me what I watch!)\n\nScrap the parenthetical.

Am I misreading this? You should clarify here.\n\n&amp;gt;I have a college degree, a career, a vehicle, a single apartment, and a passion for bad puns.\n\nIf you don't have a pun preceding \"and a passion for puns\" it loses its punch considerably. Was the angle humor here as well? You could punch it up considerably with something like this: \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\"In case you were wondering, I've got all the essentials of a grown up: a $200k degree (debt not included!), my 9-5 that pays those bills, wheels (tricycles count, right?), and an overpriced apartment chosen only so I could impress you.\" \n\n\n&amp;gt;I don't have kids or crippling student loan debt.\n\nYou have a limited amount of time and space to introduce yourself and this is what you lead with? The kids thing is another obvious fact from the right column. The debt thing doesn't tell me anything about you, except maybe that you had an easy life. Did you pay off the debt yourself? Tell me about that. Did your parents or a benefactor? Share about how they mean a lot to you or something. \n\n&amp;gt;I am looking for a women to enjoy movies, tv show binge watch marathons, coffee dates, late night food runs, and ultimately a happy future with together; a woman who is independent but empathetic, supportive but also knows when to challenge and push for what she deserves, and whose end goal playing this manic dating game is to find a true partner. Most importantly, I am seeking someone who wants their other half to help them be who they are meant to be, without reservation or judgement, and who will provide the same for me.\n\nHere's the thing, I'm looking for all the exact same things in a woman. But if you want someone of that caliber, you have to \"put out\" that you're also capable of providing those qualities *to her*. Your profile doesn't (yet) display those qualities, so it comes across as somewhat demanding/overly picky to list these all out. \n\nYou want independence and empathy? Show more of that than \"I walk dogs and don't have debt.\" Show us how you push yourself (not to be overly harsh, but 4x of exercise a week doesn't really cut it in my book). On the whole though, it's a sweet summary and at least you're clear about what you want. Women will appreciate that. \n\nAnd that pun thing? Add it here at the end: \"I'm also *banking* on a shared love of puns ;)\"","Cool cool, how long have you been single?\n\nYou can probably get much better pictures.

She spent the last 5 years helping him use the toilet and trying desperately to convince him that there is not actually a woman who lives in the clock.

I think getting called beautiful is hard to respond to because you kind of feel full of yourself or conceited if you just say \"thank you\" ... it can kind of feel embarrassing. \n\nYour goals shouldn't be for sex. Sex is a special bonus activity that comes when you really enjoy each other and feel comfortable.... and the requirements for feeling comfortable enough to have sex are different for every person and between every two people. Your goal for the first date should be to learn about each other enough to have good conversation... to find enough common ground that you can feel comfortable with each other... and most importantly to see if there's a spark.

He looked through some of my profiles (Tinder and Bumble) and told me they look pretty good, but that again, since I am looking for someone rather specific that it is probably going to take some time before I find that right person.  He says I’m doing all the right things (expanding my social circle, staying fit, etc ,) and while I know that sometimes you can do all the right things and not get the result you want, it can still be discouraging at times.  \n\nSpeaking of dating apps, the last few days of browsing them have been a bit a downer.  There really aren’t many people that are my type, and the ones I swiped and/or messaged haven’t matched me back or responded yet.

I’m debating whether I should give them a shot anyway to see if maybe I can grow and develop some kind of attraction to them, or if it would just be cruel and a waste of their time.  \n\nOn the non-dating realm, I am a week into Crossfit and am loving it so far.  Each workout has royally smoked me, but it’s awesome to learn new skills and techniques, and the people at the gym I go to have been extremely friendly and welcoming.

She stole two of my sweaters and it was okay because one was puked on by someone else.\n* Again, was still a virgin and she didn't even like basic human affection things like kissing, making out, cuddling, napping next to each other, holding hands in public. So I told her it wasn't going to work out due to that and political ideologies being so different. I don't know why I agreed when she asked me out. Guess it was loneliness. Helped her meet her husband though.\n* After the 2nd date she told me her husband died in war. That's not something you drop on someone you're getting to know. So I told her we weren't compatible and she needed time.\n* She tossed me because I couldn't read her mind to know she was not comfortable with physical contact after a BDSM show.\n* Amicable split because she was moving 5.5 hours away. I told myself I didn't catch feelings for her. It took me two weeks to realize how wrong I was.","* She became less physically attracted and drawn to me following a 3-month hospital stint where I lost all muscle mass.

She'd had one serious relationship (a 9-year marriage), and she absolutely threw the sweat pants on right about when I got out of the hospital.

We talked on the phone and texted for a few weeks before she abruptly went incognito, but we got back in contact after I looked her up on Facebook in the summer of 2016. It took her a few months to respond, but I was surprised by how receptive she was to my attempt to get back in touch with her, and we hit it off for a few messages before she abruptly stopped responding for another year. I finally got a response from her last Fall, and then she suggested that I come visit her. I told her that I could visit this summer and I really wanted to meet her, but I would have to save up for a few months. Unfortunately, I got a message back from her just a few days ago saying that she appreciates my attentiveness, but she recently started seeing someone else and that we should just remain \"online pals\". It was a shame because even though she is 10 years older than me, I was even more attracted to her in terms of *both* looks and personality than almost all other women I have dated. My hopes of going downstate for a mini-vacation and meeting her were dashed. However, at least the money I save can be used towards buying myself a car and learning how to drive, or even just traveling somewhere else if I want to.","“A sample of 10,500 people on the Badoo database revealed that 26% of 18-24 year olds would date someone over the age of 35. Nearly a third of women have dated someone 10 years older, and 9% of men would date someone 20 years older than them.”\n\nSooo, if I understand this correctly, there’s still a large discrepancy between younger men and younger women wanting to date older. Great!! More men my age that will just date younger. ","I'm 27 M. Open for 20-33. \n\n&amp;gt;Also, do you prefer dating older, younger, close in age, or doesn't matter?\n\nOf the dozens of women I've dated over the last two years, a grand total of 1 has been younger than me. Personally, I'd like to date younger, but it's hard to find women in my area who have the level of maturity I'm interested in. Many older women also don't date \"down\" to 27 because most 27-year-old guys are man-babies. ","&amp;gt;“Young men nowadays probably also recognize that older women are adept at diligently juggling so many responsibilities (career, children, housekeeping, fitness, finances, socializing), which makes them intriguing and attractive and a more secure option,” she said.\n\nDeluded optimism. To pretend that shifting gender roles are why men are willing to \"date\" up in age is just foolish. No 20 year old man says \"Ah, she's a decade older than me but look how well she takes care of children and keeps her house clean.\"\n\nRich and powerful men have always dated young women, that's not new. What celebrities are doing has very little to do with our own dating lives because it functions entirely different.","You're just lightly open to dating men that old. They on the other hand are more than willing than you to date somebody quite younger. It obvious the trend would be that men seek younger women and you have your age set to receive a whole slew of them. Also youre competing with women in their twenties and men your age might make assumptions about your willingness to wait until marriage or starting a family. I too became single at 30 and its tricky business / v competitive market. However in a large east coast city there should still be many men out there around your age who might want to date you. Find them, like them, respond to them, maybe even message them.","Go for it. He's nearly 30 and I think at that age, age gaps matter a lot less and he's more than old enough to decide for himself. \n\nI was really resistant to dating/sleeping with younger men when I first divorced and started online dating. Then I opened myself up to it a bit more, and I stay open to dating younger men (within reason - no teenagers or men in their early-mid 20s). I recommend more women start dating younger men, actually. Especially if you're both not looking for anything serious. ","It doesn't upset me that men tend to date younger and women older, but I absolutely won't go out with someone whose age is 34 and is only looking to date 21-26 year olds. \n","I don't find age gaps creepy after late 20s - it's all about lifestyle once you are an adult, and I think that after 27 or so it tends to be less about predatory natures when there is a 10-15 year gap. There are definitely difficulties, especially around communication in my experience, but I have some friends who are dating much younger, and friends who like me usually date older. ","Yes. I get along so much better with men I meet in social settings with friends. The issue is in my age range a lot of people are married...so they are friendly, fun conversations not tied to dating. Even still the few single men out there, same thing, IRL guys it is pleasant, easy and fun even if there is not romantic connection. Lately the people I have been meeting online are even worse than when I started a few years ago... incredibly dysfunctional social skills wise (talk about themselves the entire date, don't come up for air), their lives are in disarray, they have been deceptive (age, pics, relationship status, occupational status, etc). Although I have been out with a 100 different online people since my divorce, the only person I actually dated and connected with was someone I met IRL. Makes you wonder why I bother. ","Yeah, this has been annoying to me for the last couple years - especially when I clearly say I don't want them in the profile filter selection but then every like I get is from guys who have \"don't have kids but want them\" in their profile. My guess is that they aren't reading it. Bingos are everywhere for childfree women, I am hoping it gets a little easier when I am older and get out of the age range where everyone has baby fever and eleven weddings a year. Or just keep dating older - though even 47 around here \"may want kids.\"","I'm dating a girl who's actually putting in effort. Courting women in a socially conservative area gets exhausting, and it's frustrating not being able to date anyone my age or older because women have their age ranges set to their age or older. I'm worried that she seems a little young/sheltered/conservative (she's 21 and still in school living across the street from her aunt, I'm 24 and just graduated but have a lot of work experience and independent for years), but we get along in so many ways, we have similar goals in life and want to move to the same country, and it's great to have my enthusiasm mirrored. ","Oh where to start.  I think it's a 4 way tie:\n\n1.  First date with this girl starts with me picking her up from the train station to go hiking (Not abnormal, the trains are decent where I was living).  Hiking went well, but on the way back to the car she starts talking about school.  I was a sophomore in college and it didn't take me long to realize she was in high school.  A little bit of prying and I found out she was 15.  She said she was in 20, and in college in previous messages on the website.  I felt immediately uneasy about even being next to her and had to drive her home because she suddenly couldn't afford a train ticket back?  I just wanted to be done with it.  She called me an asshole when I said there wouldn't be a second date.\n\n\n\n2.  Went on a date with someone, plan was to meet at her place and go to the bar down the street.  I got there and was let in by her roommates, two guys who said she was getting ready.  Alright, I'll wait.  I joined them in watching TV.  They then broke out a foil wrapper and a pipe and started smoking crystal meth.  It has an interesting smell.  I was immediately worried but before I could leave she came down the stairs and away we went.  I was happy to be out of the house.  Conversation at the bar went well, and we decided to return to her place where she would make \"pizza\"  The pizza was a slice of white bread, a spoonful of sauce, a slice of cheese, a tomato slice, and a piece of lettuce cooked in the stove for a bit.  Absolutely terrible.  But I ate it out of politeness.  She then said it was getting late and asked me to leave, not sure why, but I sure didn't argue.  \n\n\n\n3.  Setup a standard coffee date with a girl.  I got there first, she arrived wearing fishnet stockings and some sort of top that was little more than a leather bra.  She looked normal in her pictures, so I figured it must be laundry day or something.  Started the conversation and immediately realized I was pulling teeth.  \"Do you want to get a coffee?\", I say as I sip mine.  \"No, I'm broke\". *silence*  \"Well what do you do?\". \"I don't work\".  *silence* \"Any big plans with your life then?\" \"I want to go to Paris.\" *silence* \"How will you pay for that without a job?\" \"I don't know\" *silence*.  It was infuriating and after 10 minutes I said I think we're done here. \n\n\n\n4.  Another coffee date, this time with a girl who's photos were of a fit/athletic person.  The girl who shows up is absolutely not fit, and is in fact at least a hundred pounds heavier than the one in the pictures.  Heavier even than me.  But she was really nice so I kept the conversation going.  Turned it into a walk once the store closed and there was a slight incline in the sidewalk.  She was out of breath quick and fell behind my rather slow conversational pace.  I felt really bad.  At the end I told her she was misrepresenting herself on her profile and she got sorta sad and said \"I guess you don't want a second date then?\" And I said no, I'm not okay with lying/playing tricks when it comes to dating.  She then turned and walked away, leaving me feeling like an asshole.  ","First date. Warm summer day, humid. We went for a walk, got lost, were out in the sun WAY longer than I planned on. \n\nI got dehydrated. We stopped at a gas station and I got a bottle of water and a large Gatorade. Chugged the entire Gatorade within a minute of leaving the store.\n\nHalf an hour later, we'd figured out where we are and my body has figured out I've just overloaded it with electrolytes.\n\nWe stopped into a nearby community center and I was in the bathroom for over 45 minutes crying and wishing for death from the stomach cramps. Also praying that when I walked out the guy would've bailed and left me there.\n\nHe did not. Neither of us commented on it but we both knew why I was in there for so long (I also came out shakey, pale, and clammy). I was actually so sick and exhausted that I called a (male) friend to come pick me up because I wasn't gonna make it the 20-30 additional minutes back to our cars.\n\nFriend shows up, has NO CLUE what is going on. I make the polite but insincere offer for the date to get a ride back to his car. He accepts.\n\nCue absolutely silent, awkward as hell car ride.\n\nGets back to our cars. Friend is staring daggers at me wanting an explanation, so I sit in the car while the date goes to his car. Date does not leave. Just sits in his car watching us. I finally get out of the car, go to my car, turn it on, date finally drives off, I get out of my car and back into my friend's car to explain that I just pooped myself inside out in the middle of a date and thank him for picking me up.\n\nThe rest of the date prior to that was honestly more awkward than the post-diarrhea car ride.\n\nEdit: Date did ask if I was okay and looked legit worried. Also reached out the next day to try for a more relaxed second date that wouldn't make anyone sick, but I passed, haha.","Honestly, this was a bit of a rough weekend on the dating front, and I could definitely use some advice or a pick me up.\n\nPer my therapist’s suggestion (along with some other people and friends,) in the continuing quest to meet a swolemate (and also network with the bodybuilding community,) I went to a local bodybuilding show for the first time yesterday.  The evening already started bad; what was to be only a 25 minute drive turned into over an hour due to road closures that my GPS didn’t reflect, so I barely got there in time for the show.  When I got there, I noticed that almost all the people there didn’t really give off a vibe of wanting to meet or network with people.  They mostly just kept to themselves, or within the groups that they were with.  \n\nI did try to start conversations with two ladies there, though, but neither seemed interested in talking to me so I quickly stopped and went away.  One was a competitor who was in the bikini competition, but when I congratulated her on her placement and asked her how her prep went, she only gave quick answers before going back to her phone.  Another was an absolutely gorgeous non-competitor (muscular, tall, lots of tattoos,) wearing a hoodie that promoted a personal training service.  I introduced myself, and asked her about her programs.  She quickly said to check the website, and then went back to conversing with her group.  Seeing that I probably wasn’t going to get anywhere, I left at the end of the Men’s physique competition (the women went first.)\n\nI went home pretty depressed and defeated.  I know that no one is obligated to meet new people or start conversations with people they don’t know, but I admit to feeling sad that I didn’t reach my goal of meeting any new people (and my goal of getting at least one number.).  I don’t know how to “get in” into the bodybuilding community.  Do I need to compete?  Join a hardcore gym?  There is another competition coming up at the end of the Month (a bigger one, the Jay Cutler classic) but I don’t know if it would be worth going.  All I can think about is that I could have got something nice for myself for the $45 I spent on the ticket to the show.  \n\nI went home, got a Jimmy John’s sandwich and watched a B Horror movie to help me feel better.\n\nTL:DR: Went to bodybuilding show to try to get out there to meet a swolemate, got shut down twice, no one really seemed like they wanted to chat with new people, left feeling defeated and went home to a sandwich and a horror movie.","Probably the first date with my last ex. I knew she liked dancing, so I planned an evening around that where I hopefully wouldn't be at a huge disadvantage, since I wasn't (still am not) an accomplished dancer.\n\nWe started by going to a salsa (a style she hadn't done before) lesson, which was fun. Then went to to a reasonably nice Mexican restaurant. We walked around town for a bit before heading to the Latin dance night, which is where things got interesting.\n\nThe venue didn't advertise it, but the Latin dance night was 21+, and my date had just turned 20. I'd fucked up. I chalked it up to another failure, and started to drive her home.\n\nOn the road between the town where the date was, and the town where she lived, there is a small spot between some hills which blocks out most of the light from both towns, and as we got there, we noticed that it was a very clear night with lots of stars out. So we pulled over, laid a camping blanket that I keep in my car on the hood, and put System of a Down on my car's stereo. We lay there watching shooting stars, talking, and rocking out to SoaD.\n\nIt sorta ended up being a theme of our relationship. We'd have some good plans, then something or everything got fucked up (our airbnb cancelling on us the night before our 5 year anniversary, as an example), and adapting and having a blast anyways.","This week has been fucked. I turned 33 on Wednesday.\n\nSo I went on my first ever match.com date yesterday. He initiated contact and seemed nice but I guess that on match some of our messages were getting lost so he asked if he could add me on Facebook. I didn’t mind so we started chatting there and we booked a date for yesterday.\n\nSo I end up at the restaurant he chose out and he’s 40 minutes late but I’m cool so I just sit there with my book and wait. The guy eventually finds me and he requests a hug then he said that he didn’t realize I was so short. I asked him if he read my profile but he said I wrote that I’m 5’6 on there and I pull out my phone and show him my profile and it says i’m 5’0. So he goes on a rant about how I am probably one of those chicks who refuses to date short guys and that not only is he not attracted to short chicks but short chicks are a waste of time because they’re helpless. \n\nAt this point I’m not even going to dignify that idiocy with a response and I told him that he was being incredibly rude and disrespectful and I asked him to leave. He got up and left and I had like 4 pages to go to the end of my book so I finished it then drove home.\n\nBy the time I got home I realize that he sent several messages to me on Facebook, all degrading. He said I am too ugly to live and that I should kill myself. After sleeping on it I decided to throw in the towel shut my match and OKC profile down. It’s been 3 months of getting stood up, ghosted, lied to and even dealt with one guy who was clingy but I kept an open mind and an open heart. I’m taking a break now.\n\nOn the flip-side Carlos Santana put on one hell of a show last night and it helped me feel better.","You wake up in the morning. Your alarm hasn't gone off, you can just feel the sunlight streaming in through your eyelids. You think about all the things you have to do that day - wake up, make food, shower, get in the car and sit in traffic, go to your shitty job with your asshole boss and annoying coworkers. Stare at the clock as the hours drag by, get back in traffic, go to the grocery store, stand in line under flickering lights so you can buy something to put in your empty fridge. Get back in traffic, go home... It all feels so overwhelming. Another long, long day.\n\nAnd then you open your eyes, and on the other side of your bed, another person. Asleep, still smiling. The sun playing over their hair, and the little bit of their shoulder showing over the covers. You watch them, for a quiet minute, while they breathe in and out. And you know that you can get through your day - no matter how shitty and long it is, because at the end of it you get to come back in this room and crawl back in bed with this person who loves and understands you, who likes to kiss you on the neck and cook you late night pancakes and tell you how wonderful they think you are. Who you can have sweaty passionate sex with and who will hold you afterwards and tell you that you rock their world. That they want to spend the rest of their life with you. That they will go anywhere with you. That just looking at you makes them weak in the knees.\n\nThat's why you keep trying, I guess.","Oh I'm the first one? Cool\n\nSo ex did not get his stuff. Monday I dropped it off at his door, texted him it was there. He thanked me and apologized for not doing it himself. Whatever, asshole.\n\nFriday night I had a date with a 33 year old. And it went hilariously wrong. So he picked a super nice sushi restaurant. I get there, parking is shit so I had just given my key to the valet when he texted 'sorry I can't make it, something came up at work.' Obviously I'm pissed, the valet people are super nice and don't make me pay and I drive home. I'm almost home when I get a text 'I can be there in 20 minutes.' \n\nSo I texted him that if he really wasn't standing me up, we could get ice cream in like an hour. So that's what we did, but it's clear he couldn't recover from his fuckup. He was super awkward and also complained about his boss a lot. I did enjoy talking to him and we had things in common, but he lives pretty far away (45 min+). It's funny because he must have asked me for a second date 5 times, but never texted me after. \n\nI'm still talking to the indian engineer but we didn't see each other this weekend either, so its been 2 weeks. I texted him to see if he wanted to hang out soon because i don't know why we're still talking if not. \n\nWas supposed to have a date with a guy on tinder, who asked me for a photo to prove I wasn't going to catfish. I said I would do it but I wasn't catfishing, and he disappeared after that? And another guy on bumble flaked after asking for a date too. \n\nI hate online dating. ","After a couple of weeks of messaging, I met this guy from another town. I waited for him for like 25min, during which he was messaging me like he has no idea where we're supposed to meet (he chose the spot and he's been there a million times). Finally he shows up from a totally nonsensical direction and when I asked why the hell did he go there he said 'Oh I was just curious why not' (?? from what I've later learned he probably just stood somewhere watching me wait for him).\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay whatever, we go to a nice popular bar with a garden and we spend 1h talking about topics he chose which were really random, like I'm a zero sex interest. No chemistry between us. But at least it's not unpleasant, until he just asks 'You wanna go for a walk?'. Okay fine, I get it, you're bored so we go and walk for 2 hours.  I would've said No if he didn't have to drive for 90min to get there so I play along. I get really frustrated and tired and decide to call it a day. He didn't even want to kiss my cheek when saying good bye so I figure 'Well at least it makes sense, he was disappointed sexually, we hung a bit and that's it'.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nA week passed and he gets all curious why I'm not messaging him anymore, so I explain how it's fine that he's not into me, at least we had a nice talk and a walk. Then he goes crazy calling me a silly bitch, wasn't it obvious how much he liked me, he might be in love, how I should have been satisfied with the fact he just wanted to look at me (he didn't look at me when we walked, so why push the idea of walk), why does everything have to be so physical etc.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, in the weeks that followed I found out he's got a sweet mix of Oedipus, Borderline and Peter Pan, he's totally gay but chases women and he never really had sex. Poor thing. I offered to lend a helping ear but he sent me a 30 A4 page long essay how I should change my personality or I'll die alone.\n\nYou can't make this stuff up...","1st of the year I met up with a real sweet, really cute girl who seemed pretty into me- texting me a bunch, got kinda buzzed one night and said she thought I was really cute and was really excited to meet me.  Got to the bar we agreed on, sat there for ~4 hours just talking about whatever, enjoying each others company until it closed up.  I was sick so I didn't kiss her at the end even though I'm pretty sure we both wanted to, but she hopped up and kissed my cheek before getting in her car and it was very adorable.  Had a lil day trip date thing planned after that going down to another city to do some museums and restaurants, but had to cancel because fucking northeast snow can suck my dong and she didn't wanna drive in it. Rescheduled for a movie date later, which was still pretty nice.  Ended well I thought, she told me a bunch of stuff from her favorite books she wanted to show me and joked about and etc.  while we were just hanging around the lobby talking about whatever since neither of us seemed to want to leave.  So I was felling really optimistic about maybe something coming out of all this. \n\nThen three days later she started talking less and eventually ghosted me for one reason or another, which sucked, because I let myself get invested. (a little early, so my fault I guess).\n\nWent on another date with a girl who was very nice but had no chemistry with.  Been dead in the water since then. \n\nAnd you thought you would get a happy ending out of any of this didn't you?  Got ya! \n\ntl;dr fuck 2018 see ya'll 2019","I went to a Country Bar/Club last night for a friend’s birthday.  I’m not a country music fan at all, but the place I went to (Stoney’s Rockin Country if your curious) is known as a place that singles like to go to.  Now, I’m not the most comfortable with approaching the ladies in a club environment, but I thought I would give it a shot and see if I could get a number.  I wound up talking to three ladies that night, and here’s how it went:\n\nThe first was chilling by herself, so I commented on her shirt and hair color.  She was really cute, and we chatted for a bit, but then her two friends arrived and she excused herself to see them.  She never came back, so I let them be.\n\nThe second actually came to me and gave me props for riding the mechanical bull (which, as an aside, is A LOT harder than it looks.). She was friendly, but definitely didn’t seem like extending the conversation too much, so I said thank you and left.\n\nThe third was with a bachelorette party.  I complimented her on her back tattoo piece (I asked who did her work because I’m also looking at getting another tattoo.) and we talked a bit before she mentioned her fiancé.  I addressed the group and the bachelorette congratulating her, before I left and went home.\n\nI’m a bit disappointed I didn’t get any numbers (especially the first one, who was absolutely gorgeous, but I also give myself props for actually going out and talking to random ladies (no one else in my group did.). I know it’s a bit hard to ask for feedback, but I’m not used to chatting with people in a club setting.  What do you think I could do better, and what advice do you have for me in those types of situations?\n\nAlso, a lot of the ladies that night were already with guys, or they were in groups.  How can I approach the latter?\n\nTLDR:  went to country bar/nightclub for friend’s birthdays. Talked to women, but got no numbers.  How do I do better?","- Stick to your guns\n- Stand up for yourself when it matters\n- Realize people have lives outside of you, if they're interested when they're free they'll reach out\n- Shower and wear cologne, smell matters just don't douse yourself in it\n- Dress better. Details make an impression, nice shirt, nice shoes, good color combination, and most importantly clothes that FIT!\n- Be open to trying new things\n- If you like the person you're with, appreciate what you have in front of you and the time you have together\n- Little things matter, hold the door, go out and grab coffee in the morning, pick up the tab as much as you can afford to\n- When you're about to have sex stop for two seconds and make sure they're okay with everything that's happening. Not only will you know it's all good and you have the green light, they will appreciate it more than you realize\n- Try!!! Remember their favorite food, their best friends name, all the things that you would want someone to randomly remember about you\n- Go to the dentist every 6 months, aside from the benefits that it brings, the teeth cleaning makes your teeth whiter and a better smile\n- Groom yourself. Many areas that go overlooked by guys, nose hairs, please make sure none stick out. Unibrow, tweeze that shit regularly bros. Should be no hair between your brows/above the bridge of your nose. Other random hairs keep to a minimum, arm pits, feet. Chest and back at least keep to a short length. Don't want someone to run their hand across your chest or back and have it get caught!\n- Don't drink in excess early on in dating, IE don't get sloppy drunk\n- Plan fun dates. Go somewhere cool, try an activity, something as simple as a walk through a beautiful area can make a date memorable\n\nSo much more but those are the ones that immediately came to mind.\n\nEDIT: Guess I should have specified, but clearly these bullet points aren't going to get you to appeal everyone, but will be appealing to the vast majority of people.","Dating life has definitely been a desert as of late.  A woman I matched with at a speed dating event two weekends ago is still fighting off an infection.  I text her occasionally, and she says she will let me know when she is better because she is really wants to see me again, but honestly, I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much and am trying to keep my expectations in check.  \n\nA coworker of mine who is trying to set me up with a friend of her's let me know that she is very interested in me and wants to go out with me.  However, said coworker said that her friend is currently moving, and that once she is done she will text me (my coworker gave her my number.)  That was four weeks ago, and haven't heard anything yet, so again, trying to keep my expectations in check.  \n\nHonestly, I've just been feeling very lonely the past couple of months.  Therapist has definitely been helping me out, but I've been struggling with feeling discouraged.  I haven't been active on OKC since they have made their changes with messaging, so I'm going to try and find ways to meet people outside of online.  I think I'm going to join a Crossfit gym for that.  \n\nNow I'm leaving for a leg workout at gym, and I think I will have Chinese food for a cheat meal.","I am so tired of posts on this sub about what \"women\" do.

I agree that it's tiring, and for someone who IS looking to date it is exhausting to basically feel I have a new \"relationship\" every few days that just fizzles away after a while.\n\n\nIt's not you, it's not \"women,\" it just sucks to date these days. People think they want someone, but most of us jerks are way too into our current lifestyles to actually try to fit someone in.","Meh, I don't feel sorry for people who are too picky because they some people lack self-awareness about what type of things they should let go and what type of values they should put more stock into. Obviously everyone has preferences but being a little more flexible on the type of person you will date will make you much happier in the long run. It's a balance between making sure you're attracted to them, you make each other happy emotionally and mentally, and you have similar values and ideals.

That just looking at you makes them weak in the knees.\n\nThat's why you keep trying, I guess.","My usual barber was on vacation, so I went to some rando last weekend and he fucked up my beard and basically turned it into some dipshit chinstrap neckbeard thing. It's presentable now (thanks wolfman genes), but doesn't look like my pictures, and it's not worth taking new pictures since it'll be back to normal in like 2 weeks.\n\nI might just wait like a month or two since I got some fancy microdermabrasion goop and it seems to be doing well so far for my scars. I don't know how much the women I date actually care about my skin, but it certainly doesn't help my confidence at all. So just feeling better about it even if it doesn't look a ton better would probably help a lot.","* 24/Lady/Central Kentucky\n\n* I've probably had my current profile on OKC for nearly 2 years, but I either eventually get frustrated or get too many creeps sending me messages and deactivate for awhile. On the sub? I've been lurking for probably about the same time.\n\n* New year, new me, duh! In all seriousness, I'm actually starting off the New Year pretty well. I got on a medication that mellowed out my depression last year and I start my dream job in two months (though I technically do the same job now, just not on salary), so it's all just about finally being able to enjoy those sort of things. And to make friends. I should...I should probably do that.\n\n* Single. OKC, Tinder, and Bumble. The changes on OKC are..confusing. Because I understood having to like someone before you messaged them (to prevent people from harassing people they didn't like or whatever bullshit reason OKC gave), but it seems on the sub that now both people have to like each other to receive messages?\n Which is, honestly, kind of bullshit. I sometimes clear out my likes/pass on people that if they started a conversation with me that I would probably definitely get along with. So by not showing them to me, I'll never know that. I like the idea between the new profile sections, though. Maybe now I'll see more than just 'extroverted introvert!' or 'haha i'm horrible at these, just ask me'. Maybe.\n\n* My never ending habit of lurking on relatable subreddits when I can't sleep, mostly. \n\n* ....how do you all seem to know each other? I feel like half the interactions on here are people who already know way too much about each other, haha. \n\n* And I'm too lazy to upload a picture because a) I'm at work and b) I'm not sure if I have anything in my account history I should delete before I show my face. Don't worry, though, I may eventually ~~scare~~, I mean, grace you with my presence. ","Skiing is mentioned three times in your summary, and also you start by saying your name is Justin, which...

I listen much more than I speak. But when I'm comfortable, or after a drink or two, I can be incredibly lively. Like, too lively. '**Backflipping** off a wall' lively. Seriously. Ask me to **backflip** off a wall, I'll do it.\n\n&amp;gt; **Or**, usually, I shut myself in my room all day and read. **Or** cuddle. **Or** dive deep in to whatever my current video game is. Quiet time is good time. **Unless** there is snow, then I'm skiing. **Or** not. **I dunno** these days.\n\n\nThis section is just... all over the place, and exhausting to read.

Again though, not sure how much that means coming from me.\n","This was last summer. We'd been together for about 4 months I think. At about 2 months in, he had started getting shitty. Like, the mildest form of emotional abuse. A little gaslighting here, a little screaming at me at 3am there. A lot of turning every single issue I had around on me. \"You never listen to me\" was code for \"you don't unquestioningly obey me.\" It was becoming a slow fade into me just being his little house maid, basically. \n\nThe final straw was when we were supposed to go on a weekend trip together with some of my friends, which we had planned and paid for a month prior. At the last minute, *while we were on the road driving to the destination* he told me he had decided he's not going. He would still drop me off, but he would turn around to go back. Why? Because he just didn't feel like going all of a sudden. Because of this, I had to scramble at the last minute for a ride home or risk not being able to go on the trip at all. Luckily someone had an extra seat.\n\nAfter he left to drive home, I realized I was relieved. I had a lot of fun with my friends, without him.\n\nI broke up with him a week later and we went through some weird post-breakup limbo drama. It became clear that within the span of 4 months, I had lost a year's worth of progress on improving my mental health. I was an anxious wreck all over again. A year and a half later I'm still not quite where I was.","No success in relationships, still never found anyone who liked me.\n\nI moved to this city for a new job a year and a half ago and that's going well.  Been on this sub for about that long.  I've been enjoying getting started with a job in my field.  Hoping in the new year to look for work in Boston where there's more of an established tech industry, and who knows maybe dating might be better there too.\n\nHoping to start working on International travel after I get my car loan paid off and am debt free, and hopefully that will be some time next year.  In the meantime I've got a trip to San Antonio to visit my brother next month and my family is talking about another trip to Colorado some time next Summer.\n\nGoing to FEST this weekend, and I'm really excited for that.","Try swiping again for the first time in a while\n\n&amp;gt; Are you really 27?\n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yeah\n\n&amp;gt; You look old\n\ngolden\n\nkeep 'em coming\n\nI'm not 27 anymore, I'm in my 28th year of life.\n\n---\n\nI'm super not busy at work and it's sort of annoying because I'm expected to bill hours but I don't have tasks or projects\n\nso I'm doing my homework at my desk and interviewing next Tuesday for a significant raise and the quiet promise of being worked into the ground.\n\nwill I regret getting more busy? probably.  Will it be good for me to have a change *finally*?  Yeah.\n\ndoes this mean I'll be able to afford a townhome within a reasonable distance of my new job? lol. ^no\n\n---\n\nIDK what else is there to gripe about? not much.  Oh I got nice workout shorts from two different sellers (the same make/model imported from china, just re-branded).  Ordered two mediums.  Got an XL that fits, and a L that doesn't fit at all really.  Tiny Chinese people sizes I guess?  Not sure they accept returns so I guess I have revealingly tight, nice, lounge-at-home gym pants ^^get. ^^at. ^^me. ^^ladies.","This week I got the tickets for the flight to San Antonio next month to visit my brother who's graduating from his tech school in the army then.\n\nWork is changing to one of those unlimited PTO systems which I'm not really a fan of, and accumulated PTO is basically just disappearing so I scheduled it all and I won't be working very much in December which is nice. I can spend that time looking for a potential job in Boston, ideally I'd like to leave here in February if everything goes well.\n\nToday I'm listening to a Spotify playlist of music that will be at Fest next week so I can figure out which shows to see. I'm getting really excited for that. One of my coworkers will be volunteering and working doors at one of the clubs so I'll make sure to say hi to her at some point.\n\nOn another note I've been reading up on taking better care of my hair recently, got some products recommended by /r/curlyhair and I've got a silk pillowcase arriving in the mail today. Supposedly those help your hair, but it just sounds really comfy so I'm excited to try that out tonight. ","I still haven't done much travel, don't even have a passport yet.  Now that I've finally got a job making good money, I'm hoping to have my car paid off by the end of next year and I'll be debt-free at that point, so I think that's when I'll start working on travel.","Nothing new dating related but got back into running and it feels pretty flipping great. I just got myself a vocal booth for my place arriving in the next few weeks so am super freaking excited that I'll be able to sing and play guitar and practice my evil laugh whenever the hell I want. Work is overall pretty good just humming along, probably gonna start going to local meetups a bit more and mingling with fellow nerds and see what's out there just to see if there's anything a bit more interesting out there. The positives seem to outweigh the negatives in life so far so I'm fairly grateful for that. ","Did a count from Spotify's concert's playlist and I am probably seeing about 11 more bands total this month that I am fairly into holly shit do I love September. Another one of the FAANG companies keeps spamming my inbox and I decided to finally give in and do an interview, gonna be a faiboat but the current job is going damn well so whatever. Finally found a place out here that has a good breakfast burrito option as well for delivery so that's pretty exciting too. Life's pretty good, despite suffering from cat allergies atm. ","I realize that it's April, and that means I have two term projects due in less than a month. I've already been spending all my free time after work on lectures and homework, and I've already been losing tons of sleep, but now I'll have to kick up a notch even higher, so this is shaping up to be a real death march. I'm very tired, moderately stressed, and mildly anxious. It'll probably get worse from here.\n\nI've decided to take a break from the gym and exercise for the month. Hopefully I won't deteriorate too much by the time it's all done. \n\nThis sub will be my study break, I guess.\n\nEDIT: Oh, but hey, on the positive side, I got my iPhone X today. Food pictures and selfies!!","Not really a rant\n\nI'm just worn out and tired, it's been a bit of a struggle to just get up in the morning, much less focus on my goals, or my job.\n\nI was excited earlier this week because there was a maybe promising date on the horizon but that got shot down -- \"I'm not looking to date; let's be friends\".  It was a long shot anyways no *real* loss, but lesson learned -- optimism is expensive.\n\nFeels like (and I know this is somewhat false) everyone is engaged, getting married, expecting kids (wtf? right) -- moving forward in life and I'm back to feeling like I'm basically treading water.\n\nI've got the next four days off to celebrate a friend's wedding and to spend some time with my college roommate, which will be nice.  I think I definitely need a break from work, and spending time layed out on a beach forgetting about everything... well that's a kind of therapy, right?\n\nI'm fundamentally impatient to change things in my life and things are just going so freaking slowly, it's not like I have much more time/effort to invest on that front...","Apologies for length, had a shitty week:\n\nLeft for London on Monday for a new job. Got in very late (11.30) because trains were delayed. Finally got into Marylebone, and found I'd lost my ticket. They wanted me to pay for a new one, so I bought one back home, not reneging on my airbnb, so I try again on Tuesday night. Got into London at 1.30 (trains were delayed). Went to buy Oyster card to get a bus to take me to my airbnb, but they stop selling them between the hours of 1.30 and 4.30. My friend (in America of all places), says she will book me an uber, I check where I am on google maps, and my phone runs out of battery.\nWith the option of sleeping outside Euston Station with the homeless and the rats until 4.30 in -2 temperature, I spend the next two hours walking back to my airbnb.","I think I'm just inherently bad at work-life balance.\n\nPart of the reason I decided to make $12k a year was for some work life balance doing direct service work &amp;amp; financial empowerment with survivors of domestic and sexual violence while I studied for an LSAT class/applied to law school. But now I'm also doing grant writing, event planning, volunteer coordination, creating and coordinating a new court program, back up crisis line shifts, and working in my organization's store. \n\nWhich amounts to 50-60 hours a week. And my LSAT class starts this weekend. \n\nPlus I'm trying to avoid thinking about it but my dad's dog is probably going to be put down soon. We've had him for less than a year. \n\nI'm just vacillating between sad and empty and feeling a little overwhelmed. ","Whenever I got super drunk before having sex with my ex, I'd open the diary app in my phone and write about it. I made it a habit to make an entry every morning, so when I'd wake up with a massive hangover and see: \"Ibwas pisd @ him earlier, but hes rlly a nice penis_tho.\" in my diary, it was something strange.\n\nIf I were more sexually active, I'd probably do something similar to this- making a spreadsheet. I would also write reviews to accompany the stats: \"An enthusiastic performance that was light on skill and quick in duration. Fluent dirty talk, but the fingering and oral skills were not quite up to par with regard to his age and reported amount of sexual experience. His use of the tongue was conservative, and he lacked rhythm in his movements of the wrist when stimulating the genitals of his partner, resulting in an experience that feels somewhat more jarring, distant than arousing and intimate. Overall I'd rate the hookup 2/5 Jesus sticks: ✝✝\" It looks like you're having fun. I'm not really in a position to judge you, lol.","I used the \"My Perfect Day\" subheading\n\n&amp;gt;I love watching a thunderstorm out the window while drinking some tea and getting cozy.\n\n&amp;gt;I love driving my car with the top down on open roads in nice weather and singing along to some music.\n\n&amp;gt;I love walking out in nature enjoying the sound of the wind in the trees and my own footsteps.\n\n&amp;gt;I love trying out a new recipe and having it turn out amazing.\n\nThese are some of my favorite things and I feel they make life worth living. I thought I might like to make them more of a focus in my profile, because I think this section does more than most others in actually communicating something about me. I could also probably use some improved wording on some of these. ","I think my dates are, on average, going better. In getting a bit more comfortable making some physical contact, better at keeping the conversation flowing and talking about myself, a little more aware of my date's body language, and even come up with something somewhat funny to say once in a while  or find a way to compliment my date when I'm on top of my game. I felt like the girl Sunday was on the verge of inviting me into her apartment but got nervous and backed off.  As I get better at dating overall, I'm also enjoying it a little more.\n\nAlso super excited for the music festival this weekend. ","I'm in a white collar position that requires an immense amount of critical thinking making more than the vast majority of my peers without a college degree, and with possibility to make a ton more when I hit senior level, so it'd be hypocritical for me to say getting a degree mattered. That being said I do care that a partner be into intelligent hobbies that require some amount of thought, and that their finances aren't terrible or they're on a positive path that's not going to  keep them struggling for the rest of their life. ","**About me**\n\nQuoting pirates is also not really doing anything for you.\n\n\"I'm a nice guy\" said the guy that's not actually a nice guy. -- so extrapolate from that:  \"I'm very hard to anger\" said the guy you now think might have anger issues.\n\n\"I'm loyal to a fault\" said the guy you now think might be a stage 5 clinger.\n\nIn general, show don't tell.  If you're funny, be funny.  If you're pacific, calm, loyal, well harder to \"show\" in text but easy enough to show in stories.  Honestly, people are going to be making those judgments about you when/if they meet you/text with you.\n\n\n**Goal**\n\n\"I have three...\" can get the axe; it doesn't say anything.  When writing for web be brief.\n\nPlus points for being clear that you're looking for a relationship, but maybe you don't need to defend it by saying you've been single for a while and you know what you want etc.\n\n**Six things**\n\nMakes me want to know about your guitar and abacus!\n\n**What I'm actually looking for**\n\nParagraph one is good.\n\nThe second paragraph maybe not?  Maybe just tone it down a little bit.  I get what you're trying to say and it's not bad, but it comes off as a little defensive.  Also, fundamentally, you and everyone else on OkCupid are looking for some dates.\n\n**Pics**\n\nYeah, more and better pics, especially of you making normal people faces.  Just start taking lots of pictures of yourself, get used to asking friends and strangers to take pictures of you.  Maybe get an instagram or whatever to help keep you taking pictures.  Just realize you need to kill the part of you that says \"I'm bad at taking pictures\" and get gud scrub.\n\nI wouldn't use pictures numbered (from the album, with 5 being your main):\n\n7 - don't scratch out people's faces\n\n8 - yes that is weird\n\n11 - [fear mixed with a little disgust maybe?](https://www.apa.org/Images/PSA-2011-05-matsumoto-fig1_tcm7-115934.jpg) this is a hard nope.  Not to mention grainy and whatever.\n\n12 - again, what emotion is on your face?  Not a happy one that someone would like to date.  Also old pic.\n\n\nAnyways more and better pictures!!  Good luck.","Honestly, I started making every single first date a brewery/drinks date at a location where we could sit close to each other, rather than across from each other at a table. You can punctuate jokes/stories/statements with physical touch and build physical comfort and tension throughout the date. \n\nI also focused on learning how to display positive body language as well as reading other people's body language. If you get good enough at it, you honestly can create positive body language in the other person through your own actions, which carries over to a great date more often than not.\n\nEver since I've become more physically forward on dates, I make the decision on if there will be a second date 9/10 times. Even the last few girls that didn't feel a connection, I texted them directly after the date letting them know I wasn't interested in pursuing anything further. I think the fact that most of my first dates involve me kissing them within the first couple hours and a good amount end up at my place makes them more impactful/memorable. I would never suggest everyone be as physically forward like I am though, because you have to have the confidence and not be hesitant at all if you're gonna pull it off, it has to be authentic to you. But I can't act like I didn't see a massive change when I started being more physically forward, because it made me more polarizing and killed any chance of me giving off platonic vibes. ","&amp;gt; [Serious] How does one find love when they have no equality in their career, are not compulsive dick suckers, and won't completely fall for anybody who will offer them free dinner for sex, and only gets replies from trolls and armchair activits.\n\nRofl. Not literally, but almost.\n\n&amp;gt; Instead this group hosts events for the women here to \"Learn how to play video games\".\n\nThat is like downright sexist and pointless, isn't it?\n\nI haven't witnessed any gender based inequalities at my work place so far, so that's good I suppose.\n\n&amp;gt; serious stuff\n\nBelow are the broad strokes disadvantages of males and females that I perceive from my vantage point (Canada). It's implied that these lists are comparing the genders to each other, because I don't have a base case to compare them to. For example, I included \"more judged on physical appearance\" on the female list but not the male list because even though both genders have to deal with this significantly, in my opinion women do so more.\n\nFemales\n\n- more judged on relationship status\n- more judged on sexual preferences/activity\n- more susceptible to sexual violence\n- more susceptible to harassement\n- more judged on physical appearance\n- more career and salary obstacles\n- taken less seriously intellectually\n- more negative judgement for assertive behavior\n\nMales\n\n- more expectation to pay for things and take initiative\n- more expectation towards sexual performance\n- more judged for expressing emotion\n- more judged on career choice\n- more judged on choice of hobbies and interests\n- more judged on career advancement and aptitude\n\nConclusion: society's come a long way in a short period of time (women couldn't vote like 100 years ago), and hopefully the trend continues. Even though both genders face different challenges and stereotypes, in my opinion it still remains more difficult to be a woman even in well developed countries and without considering biological disadvantages like muscular strength, periods and pregnancy.\n\nAnd of course, if your sexual orientation and gender identity is more complicated than hetero male/female or you don't live in one of the more accepting countries, things can get absurdly unfair and terrible.\n","I'm really sorry that happened to you.  \n\nI can tell you my first ex was unable to have kids due to a medical issue, and I loved her for 3+ years. Her inability to have kids was ZERO of the reason we broke up, because I don't want kids and never really have. So there are people out there like me that genuinely don't want kids and won't have them no matter what. It sucks that people \"hope\" you'll change your mind. I just said it in another topic but \"hope\" can be such a damaging emotion/feeling. You're wasting time if you're hoping someone changes, both that person's time and your own.\n\nThe reality is, all but one relationship won't last forever (if one does). Don't compromise, stand up for what you want, and draw that hard line. There are other people whose beliefs/preferences align more with yours, I promise, and it'll get better. It's a valuable lesson to learn to not compromise, and we all have to learn it the hard way.","Communication is the most important thing.  Expressing yourself \\(often\\) and fighting fair will allow you to head off most arguments before they start.  It also allows you to figure out if you are not aligned on the important things in life, and as you talk about things you will find out what is and isnt negotiable.\n\nAlso, you have to work at it.  Like any other skill, a successful marriage means you have to put work \\*into\\* it to get good at it.  Remembering empathy, the right and wrong ways \\(and times\\) to address issues, and when you have to have your partner's back no matter what \\(not always\\) are essential.  These things will change over time as people grow and change, too.\n\nIt will not always be easy or good.  Even a good marriage is tempered by hard times, frustration, and temptations.  Successfully navigating these things are how good relationships last.  Not every relationship is forever, either \\(goodness how we subbies know this\\) but this is how you keep a good one going.\n\nAlso, the relationship has to have space for you to be your own person.  You have to find what helps you thrive, and a good spouse will support that as you will hopefully support them.  We hopefully have passions \\(don't date someone who doesnt, its a trap!\\), and one of life's great challenges and rewards is pursuing them.","bless you /u/classykindasassy for organizing this and /u/_thiccc for assisting.\n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nthis was my second meet up ever and definitely my favorite so far! i can't remember the last time that i 1) stayed out so late (am an old), and 2) loved everyone that i met. everyone who attended that i talked to was genuinely so kind. i'm sure that's in large part thanks to classy's prevetting.\n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nfave memories were definitely sing screaming to 90's classics at codmother with everyone, despite the heat and not being able to move; finally meeting /u/toyaqueen after way too long &amp;lt;3; and walking five hundred miles around the city with a certain rocket scientist/other local vegan (i have no idea of your username and i'm not gonna dox your real name here!) my only regret was that the event was not long enough to get to know everyone there (particularly the push up gang- i'm gonna crash your party next time :D). guess i'll just have to go to more (NYC in August!) :)","#BAC .001,000,000% MODE\n\n*If you can start a conversation from any of these topics, I am in awe.*\n\nAll pics are Snapchat (dog) filter selfies\n\nAll pics are group pics doing sorority squat/skinny arm where you can't pick the person out\n\nMachu Piccu pic\n\nElephant pic\n\nPool photo in a donut or swan inner tube\n\nBikini wedgied up butt kneeling at edge of pool facing away from camera pic\n\nBirthday photo with golden number balloons\n\nYoga pose on top of a mountain pic\n\nEdgy bathroom mirror selfie with one foot on sink\n\nCar selfies\n\nObese people hiding it with 100% face shots\n\n\nCurvy / thicc\n\n5'x\" because apparently that matters...\n\nActually 18, not 25\n\nJob: CEO at &amp;lt;MLM pyramid scheme&amp;gt;\n\nAstrology sign\n\nMyers-Briggs personality\n\nList &amp;gt; of &amp;gt; cities\n\nIG: username\n\nSnap: username\n\nVenmo me $5 and see what happens\n\n\nLooking for my partner in crime\n\nLooking for a wedding date\n\nLooking for the Jim to my Pam / princess looking for her prince\n\nLet's lie about how we met\n\n\nI don't message first\n\nRarely on here so DM me on Insta\n\nIf you want to know just ask\n\nI suck at writing bios\n\nI super liked you on accident\n\nMy friends made me download this\n\nHere for a good time not a long time\n\nI probably swiped right for your dog / Probably like your dog more than you\n\nMother of one beautiful (boy/girl/fur baby).

IDK why, but I also like photos in which a girl's cosmetic flaws are ready and apparent. Like, I think, this girl isn't trying to put on a show or impress me. She's open and honest with who she is.","I'm just confused.\n\nI was by myself in my own world at the bar for a drink Friday night, and getting ready to leave.\n\nDrunk girl next to me decides to start a conversation by asking me if I'm gay, because I'm drinking white.  Then she asks if I'm married, dating someone, finally we settle on single.  Apparently this is confusing to her because she thinks I'm attractive (bad lighting and a lot of booze seem to do me favors) and I didn't bother trying to chat her single friend up.\n\nThey spend a lot of effort trying to make fun of me for drinking white wine.\n\nHer friend is cute.  We have a brief moment of good conversation.\n\nI get her number and leave after they go out to smoke.\n\nI text her the next night after I finish my test just to see what's up.\n\nShe basically defaults right back to trying to make fun about my drinking white wine.\n\nMy question: is having a glass of white wine *really* that big of a deal?\n\nAlso IDK if I should try texting the cute friend, just let it go, skip texting and suggest a drinks date, skip texting and suggest a dinner date.","I think this is a pretty normal attitude. It could be worth writing something in your profile, but unless you mean that you are not very sex-motivated in general (ie. That you don't have a high sex drive, or wouldn't have \"regular\" sex even later in a relationship) the \"I'm not just in it for sex!\" thing is not a detail I trust in a profile. A lot of people claim this and act like horndogs in person (men + women). Try to express your interests well and message people who seem to care about the same stuff, and hopefully your dates will go well.","I just want to say that I have been in the exact same situation before (sex was incredible and the guy was absolutely wonderful too). Until things are defined, I keep dating others. Two dates is still very new into things and you just never know what may happen. Despite him saying he is not seeing others, that doesn't mean too much unless something is defined. I have learned this lesson the hard way.","First rule of OKCupid - you don't talk about OKCupid. (or any other online dating platforms for that matter).\n\nUsed the word calisthenics on profile - sploosh. \n\nI would leave out the BA and MA, weird thing to prioritize starting with and comes off a little braggy. \n\nDelete everything from \"There's much...\" to \"writing these things.\" This profile is to give a sense of who you are and what it would be like to date you. Try not to break the 4th wall, it's awkward and honestly we don't care.\n\n\"but I don't often go\" \"but I doubt I always will be\" these sound very passive. Try to write with a little more confidence, it's a lot more attractive. \n\n\"May sound pretty typical\" yeah it does, why not tell us in more detail so it's actually interesting? For example I plan to move to France in a couple years, adopt a kid at some point and come back to the US to completely switch careers and become a school teacher. It doesn't have to be accurate; everyone knows things don't often work out that way, what's important is that you actually have a plan and you can articulate it passionately. \n\n\"maybe one day! A man can dream.\" Again, super passive.\n\nUsing the colon before The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a lot more awkward than just integrating it into the sentence (i.e. \"back to a lot it would be The Good, ...\")\n\n\"Unfortunately, I'm not too hopeful...\" - impressive, you've made this sentence meta, passive, *and* pessimistic. The rest of your \"looking for\" section isn't very helpful, that's stuff you can easily filter yourself and just makes it sound like you've got an unattractively low bar. \n\nAll in all, decent but could use a lot of tweaks. It should be less passive, more specific, and more optimistic. I've noticed that you don't really mention any hobbies. Most people overdo it on that front, but it does help to talk about at least a couple so that people can connect with you or give them talking points. ","This guy sounds really weird, listing himself as a demisexual isn't likely to help him, and 19 hours absolutely isn't enough for most actual \"demisexuals\" to develop that connection if they're serious about it. The ex thing probably happened, and I do think it played a role in him becoming distant. He did seem to want sex though and seemed to bail when you held back. Both of you obviously have your own agency to decide if you want to have sex, and what it means if you do or don't. He seems to have made his choice.\n\nI can say as a very sexually-driven guy, I've found that if a girl holds back sexually, we don't click as well, because I need that before I really connect with a girl. If we go 2-3 dates without getting sexual, I kind of feel like I'm spinning wheels, right or wrong. I'm not at all condoning his actions, because it sounds like this dude tried to play it off like he was cool with waiting when he wasn't, which is disingenuous. And you were only though two dates, one of which was overnight, which displays a ton of interest. But I do understand the feeling of wanting a girl to be on the same page as me sexually. It's possible he thought sex could be a long way out unless you made a comment like \"I think you're incredibly sexy, and it'll happen really soon, just not tonight\" to indicate you were planning on it happening the next date. \n\nThe reality is, even as a super sexual guy that prefers sex on date 1, if I'm super into a girl, I'd wait until date 3 played out and then would at least have a conversation about needing things to escalate physically, I wouldn't just dip out. I don't think you lost out on much here, even if he was genuine in his interest for you, he's got way too much baggage between his ex and not accurately communicating what he wants/needs.","1. Buy dinner! If she is interested then hopefully she will offer to pay at the cinema. \n\n2. I would avoid complimenting her body until the conversation leads to workout, gym, or health. Instead, upon meeting her, you can compliment her beauty, hair, smile, eyes, or dress. “Wow, you’re even more beautiful in person” is a great one for someone you met online. \n\n3. Keep this one handy for conversation starters: F.O.R.D. = Family, occupation, recreation, dreams. You can’t go wrong there. Remember to be yourself and have fun. When you meet her for the first time, introduce yourself. If you want to be funny, you can say something like “I bet you’re glad I’m the same person from the pictures you’ve seen.”\n\n4. Don’t know what a jumper is. I’m thinking you should go with jeans and a polo or button up shirt. If it’s cold outside, a sweat or light jacket would be nice. Avoid looking too casual as you both are going for dinner and first impressions are key!\n\n5. “I really enjoyed getting to you know you more tonight.” “We should get together again soon!” “I can’t wait until we go out again.” The point here is to let her know you had an amazing time and definitely want to do something again really soon. \n\n6. What time is dinner and the movie? If it’s later at night (7pm or later) and she still wants to go to the cinema afterwards, then you are most likely getting laid. Near the end of the date, if you truly see yourself wanting to see her again or possibly having a relationship with her then I advise you not to have sex on the first date. Instead, wait three dates and it will be even more enjoyable. If you end up having sex on the first date, it could only just be a hookup and be prepared for that. If you develop feelings then I would wait. If she’s serious about you, she will have no problem with waiting as well. As far as hygiene goes, come prepared. Shower before the date and bring some gum or mints for afterwards. Different cultures have different customs so do what feels right for you and her.\n\n7. Just be yourself! Be confident and a gentleman. Get to know her more. Open the door for her. If you’re driving, then open her passenger door for her. If your walking around in a city, then remember the guy walks on the side closest to the street. Above all, take a deep breath, relax, and have fun!","Take more initiative. Whenever a girl doesn't suggest a date, I'm going to suggest going out for drinks. If you don't want to be in that situation, start messaging guys yourself. Also, just because a guy goes out all the time doesn't mean he's not educated. I'm liberal, conversational, well educated and proper. But I like drinking. Those aren't mutually exclusive things.\n\nWhen you're talking to guys, ask them how they typically spend their weekends. If you never want to go to bars or clubs, you could even ask a question like \"What would you prefer to do on a Friday night in general? Go out for drinks and shut the bar down or spend a quiet night in?\" \n\nAlso as far as \"hookups\" go, not every guy wants a hookup if he is physically driven so I caution you against saying guys that go out just want to drink and fuck. Personally, I don't really become emotionally connected to someone I'm seeing until sex happens, so if anything, I'm trying to connect MORE with my partner when I'm advancing things physically. Flat out, I'm far more interested in women once we've gotten physical because I actually feel desired by them. This isn't all guys, but I just wanted to provide that perspective.\n\nI take it you want to advance slowly physically and meet someone serious, so my suggestions are:\n\n* Take more time talking to someone before you meet and KEEP THEM INTERESTED. What this requires of you is reaching out and starting/keeping conversation going during the time you talk to them before meeting. I'm substantially more serious about women that demonstrate they want to get to know me and show enthusiasm about meeting me.\n\n* Weeknight dates that are neutral site dates (not close enough that you could very easily go back to one of your places). ","As a guy, just pay the first date every time. If dates are becoming too expensive for you to pay for the first date, there are ways around that.\n\n* Save dinner for date #2 or 3. Honestly, if date 1 (drinks) goes well, I usually make dinner at my place for the next date or 2 and girls are really happy with this. If you go on multiple dinner and drinks dates a week, yeah, that shit will get expensive. \n\n* There are happy hours at plenty of bars. If drinks are too expensive, find a happy hour and schedule a date at 6:30 instead of 7. You get the bonus of more time together if things go well, and the drinks are a tad bit cheaper.  As an addendum to going out for the drinks, if the date is just meh, don't suggest a second round of drinks.\n\n* If drinks are still too expensive, go out for coffee.\n\n* If coffee is too expensive, find a free event in your town that you can walk around. A lights show for Christmas for example. At worst, meet at a park. Obviously these are tougher during the winter. \n\nBasically if you're going on enough dates that it's burning a hole through your wallet, either be more selective or more creative with your dates. Girls (IN GENERAL) take really, really well to a guy paying for the first date. If the date sucks after an hour, there's nothing wrong with cutting it off after one round or one coffee. ","Lots of women enjoy sex. Not wanting men to openly discuss sex with us during messaging doesn't mean we don't enjoy sex. I don't know any woman who doesn't love and enjoy sex. You're just going to have a very difficult, if not impossible, time finding what you want. Most of us want to at the very least get a drink first. Why would I just come over to your place and fuck you when you can't even invest an hour or so of your time to meet me in public first? \n\nI'm cool with casual sex but you have to offer something good enough for me to want to leave my house/invite you over for. ","OK, so your profile is reasonably well written and inoffensive. Obviously being pansexual, a-gender (a word apparently so unusual that my laptop will not accept it without a '-') and non monogamous is going to narrow down your dating pool. I have never heard of where you live so I assume it's not a huge town. I would suggest setting your distance settings as wide as possible.\n\nYour photos also aren't great. See the sidebar for how to improve.\n\nFinally, having an age range of 18-40 for a person of 35 is going to be red flag for a lot of people. Consider increasing your min age to at least 21 to avoid looking predatory (or perhaps 22 if you prefer that your dates can pay for themselves) and possibly expanding upwards in age range by an equal number of years.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck","Sounds like you have a very unrealistic idea of love and dating. Real life isn't like the movies where you lock eyes with a stranger across an airport terminal and decide to skip your flight because you know you've found your soulmate. Real life (at least for us non-billionaires) isn't like the Bachelor where you go whitewater rafting for Date 1, enjoy dinner in Paris for Date 2, and go on safari for Date 3, and never have to worry about (or even see) the bill because someone else's paying for all of it.\n\nReal life is both of you working Monday-Friday (maybe more) and getting home exhausted. Real life is coffee at Starbucks in lieu of whitewater rafting. A stroll in Central Park in lieu of an African safari. Dinner at Applebee's in lieu of an evening in Paris.","Is it possible that you’re feeling used rather than feeling guilt necessarily? It sounds like you want something substantive (as well) and maybe she just wanted sex. Especially if this is the first time you’ve had early stage or more casual sex it’s okay to take some time to process those feelings.\n\nRegardless, there is nothing for you to feel guilty about. \n\nReach out again if you want to see her again. If you want to talk about it, open that conversation with where you’re at. It’s pretty early for a blunt “What are you looking for?” She might not know yet.","Well this week has been a rollercoaster.\n\nI had a great first date on Thursday. We'd had a pretty intense sexting convo the night before so I didn't expect much of it – usually, when you start talking about sex stuff really early on it becomes hard to impossible to connect on any other level. But then she showed up and I quickly noticed how wrong I was this time. She was charming, intellectual, talkative... We clicked great and had a long, excited conversation. This was followed by some of the most mind-blowingly intense sex I'd ever had. She told me afterwards that she'd never let herself go like this, the first time with someone new, but that she felt comfortable with me.\n\nIt all added up to me walking home with a big dopey grin on my face the next morning. I cancelled the date I had for Saturday (second date with someone I was on the fence about) and eagerly looked forward to the next date we had set, for Sunday afternoon – today.\n\nWe meet for a picnic date, sit in the park, eat bread rolls and talk. Sparks aren't flying as much as on the first date but conversation flows naturally and comfortably. I walk her home, and then she's suddenly all 'I kinda spooked myself with how fast this all went, I've got to take a moment to figure out if I really want this...' (Translation: yeah, no way we're going on another date.)\n\nAnd I'm like, fuck me. For the first time in forever I have an awesome date with someone I really click with and who seems really into me as well – and even *that* can go up in smoke for no apparent reason? What do I have to do?!\n\nAt no point during either date did I notice any reluctance or discomfort from her; at no point did I push her to do anything she wasn't up for initially. So... yeah, wanting to take things slow is valid I guess, but couldn't you have thought of that *before* we were having breakfast together?","First of all how old are you? It would be helpful to see the \"About me\" section so we can get an idea of who you are and what you're looking for.\n\nOverall it's pretty good, but could use some improvement.\n\n**Most important part, the pictures:**\n\nFirst pic is quite bad. I don't recognize the filter that's been applied, looks like a weird mix of very poor foreground highlighting (and gaussian blurring of the rest) and compression or cell shading, but whatever it is is terrible. The photo is ugly and we can't see your face.\n\nAlso try to keep all of your pics from the last year, maybe two years if you really don't have enough. A picture from 2015 when 2019 is coming up fast is unacceptable. \n\nFewer pictures with hats. We should know whether you have hair or not before the 8th picture.\n\nNot a fan of pics of people holding other people's kids. Feels a little, idk, creepy or desperate? Like \"women like kids, right?\" sort of thing. Also not a great pic of you anyway.\n\nYour second picture is probably the best, I would make that your main until you can find a better one\n\n**The profile:**\n\n&amp;gt;  interested in life \n\nSuper generic and boring. Your opener especially needs to be a bit more punchy Now that people can only see the first sentence or so when swiping. It takes work, but it's helpful to get straight at the heart of who you are here to draw people in.\n\n&amp;gt; I'm currently making some sacrifices to build a business, while still making a point of enjoying life. \n\nYou would sound much more date-able if you left it at \"Working hard to build my own business.\"\n\n&amp;gt; Kent for a bit, now that I've got some time, looking \n\nKent for a bit, but now that I've got some time I'm looking\n\nTry to proofread more. \"Kid\" also shouldn't be capitalized. \n\nPersonally I think the  exclamation marks joke is a little tired. I would change the eight-year old sentence to: \" Acting like an eight year old that has just realized there's no one to tell him off\" (feel less forced without the exclamation too) \n\n&amp;gt; Glastonbury Festival I keep returning to for   \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt; and decent modern stuff sci-fi too \n\nAre you not a native English speaker? I might put that at the top of the profile so people aren't put off by it.\n\n&amp;gt; Last  one I mixed up Sashsa and Digweed with Foo Fighters as an idea of  eclectic tastes. \n\nWhat does this mean? Last one of what? At the last festival? Are you a DJ? I don't mind your sentence fragments as they give a better sense of your personality and how you talk, but make sure you actually have proper context for them.","Soo the guy I’ve been seeing canceled last minute due to a work emergency.  Yeah I understand running a business is hard and unpredictable but I still get to be annoyed by a last minute cancellation.  No I didn’t sound happy on the phone.  I haven’t communicated much with you since Sunday and you call to cancel.  That’s nothing to be happy about.  I’m sure I’ll be in a better mood later tonight when he calls but right now I’m not happy.   To his credit he did apologize and acknowledge his low communication was not okay.  I’m not someone that needs full blown text convos everyday but a little something here and there is nice.  I’m not super needy but radio silence for 3 days does make me anxious.  Probably something I should work on but it’s also not ridiculous to expect communication every couple days.  I still really like him.  I just want to spend time with him.  That’s all.  \n\nPS: kinda of proud of myself in a weird way.  Typically I’d bend over backwards to brush off things that bother me as no big deal or “it’s cool”.  While I wasn’t rude I didn’t pretend like I was unbothered by the situation.  ","I have this side project where I conduct monthly interviews with local musicians in front of a live audience. It's sort of like a talk show. I don't really know what I'm *doing*, but it's been running for a little over a year now and it's starting to pick up some notoriety.\n\nThis week I was invited to sit on a roundtable discussion about challenges facing live music in my city and province. It was pretty cool, as the majority of people in the room were representatives from much bigger and more well-established organizations (touring/management companies, record labels, festivals). But people seemed to genuinely find my thoughts valuable, and I learned a lot. Made some great contacts too.\n\nThen I met with these other guys whose local music podcast is about to be turned into a radio show. They're looking for content, and we talked about combining efforts. Which would be great, as it's a whole new audience that I don't have to hunt down in a medium that I don't have to produce myself.\n\nLast night I went to a show put on by this month's guest artist, and I got a chance to talk to a bunch of other musicians who are stoked on the idea and want to see it succeed. Part of my goal is to turn into a resource that other musicians can use, so the fact that they're enthusiastic means that I'm succeeding in that regard at least.\n\nIt's really fulfilling to see a pet project taking shape and actually starting to yield results.","I appreciate that there is some amount of generational distinction between swingers and the new poly crowd. That being said - I used to DJ a bi-weekly swingers party where 50-100 married couple would get together and, well - fuck each other and dance basically.\n\nI was not into the scene, and to maintain balance in my relationship (and because it was the best people watching in the known universe) I brought my girlfriend with me most of the time to help out. We were about 10 years younger than the average couple there - I was 34-35 at the time and she was in her late twenties. I'm not a guy you would pick out of a crowd unless you're a mustache fetishist, but she was pretty good looking.\n\nSo the point I'm working toward here is what the experience of being hit on by couple 10 to 20 times a night was like. On the one hand - as you point out - they all wanted to fuck us. And we did not have a profile in between us and them letting them know that they're chances were zero. So, given the nature of the event and our position on a stage - of course everyone tried to fuck us. It was very much like they were being polite to do so.\n\nSo we learned to politely decline, and it was an interesting and kind of unique social interaction for me.\n\nIt is my observation, having spent a year or so moving in these circles as an outsider, that there is a huge attraction to bringing newbies into \"the lifestyle\". And generally this is well intentioned; these folks feel as though they have liberated themselves from some set of arbitrary social confines and have good news to spread. I'm using that terminology deliberately; there is a massive religious undertone to the whole thing, and certainly a cult mentality developed. This runs stronger with the swinger crowd than the poly folks, who experienced a greater rejection from their culture than poly people do. I put it down to branding and the internet, I guess.\n\nBut I still get that cult vibe from a lot of poly people I meet around. Like they think they know a secret about life that I don't. Which I find to just be an insufferable human trait regardless of its focus or origin.","I used to live in Florida, and it was a total horror show there. I had something like only 2 matches over 90% in the entire state. I looked into it for a couple of days, was totally appalled and depressed by the whole thing and gave up.\n\nThen I moved to Seattle, where my demographics are (theoretically) much better, and have cautiously been testing the waters here. I have gotten a surprising number of likes and messages, but 95% of them have been from men who apparently didn't bother to read any part of my profile. I state pretty unequivocally that I am 1) very, very childfree and will not date a single dad, and 2) that I am very, very monogamous and hetero and will not date a poly man or a couple, and yet it seems like every other person who messages me is a parent of small children, and/or a couple looking for a unicorn, and/or a dude in an \"open relationship\" (right...). Surely there are some single people in this city who are not poly, right? So that has been pretty irritating and a waste of time trying to sort through all that. I also seem to be very attractive to the pathologically nerdy 40-year-old-virgin neckbeard contingent, which is also not what I am looking for (although I dig non-socially-awkward, pro-hygiene geeks). \n\nOverall, I feel like I need to tweak my profile a bit to try to discourage the neckbeards, and probably send out some messages myself to a handful of the men in my area who actually seem like they might be a good match for me (no kids, profile pics don't make them look like they sleep with a waifu pillow).\n\nShockingly, I also met and spent several hours talking/flirting with my super attractive real-world neighbor last week (was starting to think there were no actual single men my age left in the non-online world), but was an idiot and failed to give/get a number at the end of the night and haven't seen him around the building since then. Was considering trying to figure out when he walks his dog and \"accidentally\" running into him. He has part-time teenage daughters, though, so I kind of have mixed feelings about it.","The 22-year-old revealed how she becomes paranoid that men were after her cash.\n\nShe said she has now checked herself in for counselling after her jealousy nearly ended her latest relationship.\n\n\nJane, who won £1million on the EuroMillions aged 17, has been dating Dundee midfielder Jordan, 19, since September.\n\nShe told the Mirror: “Winning the lottery made me a ‘psycho girlfriend’, the money made it too easy to keep an eye on what boyfriends were doing.”\nSpeaking about how it affected her relationship with Jordan, Jane added: “My jealousy led to a break down in our relationship, we split up and are now taking each day as it comes.”\n\nShe revealed how she set up a phone app to find out where he was at all times and checked his social media.\nJane, from Edinburgh, said: “Whenever he went somewhere that I didn’t recognise, I’d call him and ask where he was, just to see if he lied to me – he had no idea I was monitoring him.”\n\nShe then acquired GPS trackers on the internet and put one in his car.\nBut she knew it went too far when she nearly hired a private detective to check if Jordan was cheating.\n\nhttps://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/691471/jane-park-lottery-twitter-lotto-winner-jealous-tracker-on-boyfriends-car","Honestly, this was a bit of a rough weekend on the dating front, and I could definitely use some advice or a pick me up.\n\nPer my therapist’s suggestion (along with some other people and friends,) in the continuing quest to meet a swolemate (and also network with the bodybuilding community,) I went to a local bodybuilding show for the first time yesterday.  The evening already started bad; what was to be only a 25 minute drive turned into over an hour due to road closures that my GPS didn’t reflect, so I barely got there in time for the show.  When I got there, I noticed that almost all the people there didn’t really give off a vibe of wanting to meet or network with people.  They mostly just kept to themselves, or within the groups that they were with.  \n\nI did try to start conversations with two ladies there, though, but neither seemed interested in talking to me so I quickly stopped and went away.  One was a competitor who was in the bikini competition, but when I congratulated her on her placement and asked her how her prep went, she only gave quick answers before going back to her phone.  Another was an absolutely gorgeous non-competitor (muscular, tall, lots of tattoos,) wearing a hoodie that promoted a personal training service.  I introduced myself, and asked her about her programs.  She quickly said to check the website, and then went back to conversing with her group.  Seeing that I probably wasn’t going to get anywhere, I left at the end of the Men’s physique competition (the women went first.)\n\nI went home pretty depressed and defeated.  I know that no one is obligated to meet new people or start conversations with people they don’t know, but I admit to feeling sad that I didn’t reach my goal of meeting any new people (and my goal of getting at least one number.).  I don’t know how to “get in” into the bodybuilding community.  Do I need to compete?  Join a hardcore gym?  There is another competition coming up at the end of the Month (a bigger one, the Jay Cutler classic) but I don’t know if it would be worth going.  All I can think about is that I could have got something nice for myself for the $45 I spent on the ticket to the show.  \n\nI went home, got a Jimmy John’s sandwich and watched a B Horror movie to help me feel better.\n\nTL:DR: Went to bodybuilding show to try to get out there to meet a swolemate, got shut down twice, no one really seemed like they wanted to chat with new people, left feeling defeated and went home to a sandwich and a horror movie.","This week has been fucked. I turned 33 on Wednesday.\n\nSo I went on my first ever match.com date yesterday. He initiated contact and seemed nice but I guess that on match some of our messages were getting lost so he asked if he could add me on Facebook. I didn’t mind so we started chatting there and we booked a date for yesterday.\n\nSo I end up at the restaurant he chose out and he’s 40 minutes late but I’m cool so I just sit there with my book and wait. The guy eventually finds me and he requests a hug then he said that he didn’t realize I was so short. I asked him if he read my profile but he said I wrote that I’m 5’6 on there and I pull out my phone and show him my profile and it says i’m 5’0. So he goes on a rant about how I am probably one of those chicks who refuses to date short guys and that not only is he not attracted to short chicks but short chicks are a waste of time because they’re helpless. \n\nAt this point I’m not even going to dignify that idiocy with a response and I told him that he was being incredibly rude and disrespectful and I asked him to leave. He got up and left and I had like 4 pages to go to the end of my book so I finished it then drove home.\n\nBy the time I got home I realize that he sent several messages to me on Facebook, all degrading. He said I am too ugly to live and that I should kill myself. After sleeping on it I decided to throw in the towel shut my match and OKC profile down. It’s been 3 months of getting stood up, ghosted, lied to and even dealt with one guy who was clingy but I kept an open mind and an open heart.

Your pictures are going to be more important on OKCupid now than they used to be since the app opens to a swiping interface by default. And your profile should be a lot shorter than I would have suggested making it say 3-4 years ago. People don't want to devote 5 minutes to reading a profile when there are so many options available in the dating world.\n\nAlso, match percentages are definitely inflated compared to a few years ago. I almost never run into a profile that's below a 75% match for me (Met a serious GF on OKCupid in 2012 that was a 67% match with me for example). I do think getting the high match% (it'll be in green when it's above 90%) with people is actually more important than before since you're shown less info about people on the swiping interface rather than reading the whole profile. Keep the amount of questions you answer somewhat low (no more than 200) and that should help inflate your match % a bit.\n\nMy tips for OKCupid would be to swipe on people every couple days and then message any mutual matches you have afterwards. You CAN message before matching, but I've found girls aren't nearly as responsive if I message them before we mutually \"like\" each other. I think it's because they log on, swipe, and wait for guys to message them, similarly to Tinder. So if you've messaged them, they can see the message and read it, but after they finished swiping, they don't always remember to go back and message you back.\n\nAs far as Tinder goes, yeah, sign up for Tinder Plus. A 6 month plan is like $6/month and for unlimited swiping and 5 super likes a day it's worth it. It's not so much about pay to play as it is that online dating is simply way more competitive now than it was 3-4 years ago because so many more people have adopted it. I definitely remember getting 4-5 matches a day on Tinder even a couple years ago vs the 2-3 I get now when I'm actively swiping, but the matches I'm getting translate to dates more often. Work on your pictures and profile and get those in tip-top shape if you want to get matches.","&amp;gt; -I never pressured kiss/touch them(though I want) I just suggested a hug and they always smiled and hug me back together\n\nUh, if you're not physically escalating on any of your dates, that's gonna be a big issue. Women want to see a guy that's confident enough to go for what he wants. If you want to kiss her and it's a reasonable time to do so, you should go for it. If you want to touch her arm or leg to punctuate a joke, do it. She will communicate if it's uncomfortable either through her body language or with her words, and then you can respect whatever barriers she has. You're more often better off opting that way than being completely physically reserved. Most girls aren't gonna be fawning over a guy who's scared to touch or kiss them after 2 or 3 dates. And while physical touch isn't necessarily required on date 1, you're certainly not helping your chances if you come off as physically timid/reserved as you indicate in your post.","It's hard for guys, those who are pretty decent are also very conscious of not putting pressure on the girls they're interested in. Sadly that respect can come across as disinterest but most guys will tell you if they're not interested. He's probably not going to go out with someone he doesn't like. Probably\n\n&amp;gt;how can I make sure that I'm not annoying him over text or coming off as too intense and that he actually wants to continue to spend time with me?\n\nI would say just be yourself. If you suspect that he may not be interested, maybe he always takes a day to respond to your messages say, then you're going to have to ask him point blank. Personally if someone doesn't want to talk to me then I'm not going to be happy even if they say they're interested. So part of that is knowing what you want and need and making sure you get it.\n\n&amp;gt;How concerned should I be about the stereotypes of guys wanting the chase since I've made myself so available to him?\n\nI really hate this Zombie myth. Why would someone want to chase a person that's not interested in them? Who's going to waste their time to be repeatedly rejected?","**My Self Summary**\n\nI make music, websites, and the occasional witty remark.\n\nI think I just want what everyone else wants: To come home after a hard day of work and be greeted at the door by my love.

I'm worried I am going to come across as too much of an outsider because I'm not big and lean enough.\n\nI've been struggling with body image issues, and going to therapy has helped immensely, but while I am excited for this event it's making me nervous again (I always get a bit nervous when I try something new.  Hell, I forgot my home address with I went to a game shop for the first time to buy Magic The Gathering cards as a beginner.)","I'm still trying to figure out what my \"league\" even *is* tbh. Guys have mostly ignored me or viewed me as a friend over the course of my life, so I have relatively limited practical experience. I've only gone out with 2 guys in my life, one I dated for 4 years and one I went out with twice and then he ghosted me. Both those guys were *really* attractive. But this year so far I've been randomly approached by *5* different guys, which is a 500% increase of my previous yearly average. However, none of these guys were cute. So yeah idk. \n\nWeird note, all of the guys who approached me this year have been Indian exchange students at my college. I've been going here for 2.5 years and there are a lot of Indian guys, but none of them have ever said boo to me till now, so I'm not sure what I'm evidently doing now to attract them. Or, to be flagrantly shallow about it, why the cute ones aren't going for whatever it is.","Disclaimer: I'm a dude.  But I'm also a fairly average lookin' Asian dude that did really well, so I probably have a few things that may help.  \n\nPics:  elephant in the room, and you've already mentioned it.  Your pics suck.  I don't think you look bad, but your pics suck.  You don't vary your facial expressions much, and that may be off putting.  Uninteresting backgrounds, kind of dull pics... you need better pics.  As an Asian guy with terrible effing hair that's as straight as an arrow, getting your hair done up goes a LOOONG way.  Trust me on that and feel free to ask questions.  Your captions are kind of humorous, which is quite a juxtaposition with how serious you look in all of them.  \n\nProfile:  That first bit with the \"People that know me would say I'm\" bit is kind of... not flattering to you.  I get it's prob supposed to be funny, buuuut I don't know. From a top down perspective, listing more of the other stuff that moves you would be nice. It's not bad and you're well spoken I would say. Also take off that A-lister bit at the end.  It's not a bad profile, but I'd put some HUMOR in this.  Obviously you have it, per your captions.  Put some funny stories/asides about cooking experiments that went sideways or whatever.  \n\nWhat are your messages like? ","We all learn things from relationships. Sometimes we learn we took what we had for granted and learn to appreciate partners in ways we didn't before. Sometimes we learn that we have to put ourselves first and that our needs have to come first. \n\nIt sounds like a lesson you've learned from your recent relationships is that communication and transparency is crucial.  And honestly, I couldn't agree more. I had one without great communication for 3.5 years, and 1 for 1 year with amazing communication, and the 1-year relationship felt way stronger.  From the relationship with your ex you saw recently, you clearly learned that you can't let things go unaddressed and have to nip things in the bud before they fester and grow into messes that can't be fixed. I think that's a pretty valuable lesson to learn and take with you. If you're fully transparent and communicative from day 1, and create an environment where communication is encouraged, it should continue throughout the relationship. \n\nAlso, try to look at every single date/relationship/interpersonal interaction as something you can learn from. I feel like from every single date you can refine your process a bit and refine what you are (and aren't) looking for in a partner. Even the bad relationships should be lessons you can learn from.\n\nAnd please don't pain yourself with the \"What ifs\" about past relationships. You broke up for a reason, remember that, and try not to focus on only the positive nostalgia. There was enough negative that the relationships ended too. There's nothing wrong with having a high opinion of one of your exes and thinking they were a good person, but they were incompatible with you and you ended things. Focus on the mindset you were in when you made that decision, and move forward without second guessing what you did. Focusing on the past can paralyze you.","Embrace the emotions, don't try to hide from them.  Cry, throw shit, complain to people, watch sad movies, delete pictures, whatever you have to do.  Recognize when you're feeling shitty and know that you'll get through it.  Let it come, accept it.  But don't allow it to become a downward spiral.  Don't focus on that person or the what if's or whatever.  Think about how it can be better next time.  Know that feeling the feelings means you're preparing for the next one, you're moving on.  Maybe even have a little fun with the opposite sex when you're ready, but don't get too serious until you've really moved on.  Care for yourself.  Comfort yourself when you get upset.  Reach out to friends, even if you don't want to talk about the feels.  Go to therapy if you need it.  Yes, it comes in waves, but one day you'll really accept the bad feelings and then suddenly you've moved through them.  You're on the other side.  The acceptance allows you to move on, you're no longer upset.  Then you're ready again.","Yea, they absolutely took a big chunk of my self esteem, especially cause I also had zero luck in real life so it was just additional rejection. You’re gonna have to pull real hard from other areas of success from your life like career and hobbies. Yea there’s gonna be times where it all of them are falling through and that’s when it helps to have friends and a handy therapist if you need it (thanks grad school for the free sessions).\n\nWhat did help me a bit but my best friend thought was ridiculous, was that I’d delete my account cause what’s he fucking point, then a day or few later deactivate and re-do it from scratch. It came out better and better each time (except for pics). \n\nIt’s tough but keep on keeping on. Science be with you.","Best guess would be that she wasn't feeling the sexual attraction. Now this isn't always the case, but because you said this is what always happens to you it sounds like 3 dates means she liked you and was hoping that attraction would come, but it just didn't.\n\nLet me ask you this. Did you kiss her? Hold her hand? Anything romantic/sexual? Obviously you hopefully see signs before you do that, but I'm asking because maybe she was hoping you would make a move but didn't. \n\nAnother question, was she the only girl you were dating? Did you keep messaging/swiping/keeping an eye out for meeting other people in real life while you were dating her? If you're like the old me, then the answers no. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with dating one person at a time, focusing on them and really trying to get to know them. Unfortunately, that may come across as \"needy,\" always being available to go out whenever she's free. Obviously you could make your life busy with other things besides dating other people, hobbies, career, friends, whatever. This point was meant to be, did you seem like you had your own awesome life that would be interesting enough to her that she might want to stick around and be a part of that, or was your life somewhat centered around dating her?\n\nLastly, and be honest with yourself and us, are you confident? If you didn't make a move in 3 dates, I'll wager the answer is no. Confidence is very sexy, for men and women. Being confident in yourself and knowing that you have a ton to offer, are interesting, funny, and that any woman would be lucky to get a date with you is very obvious. That doesn't mean arrogant and a douche, but knowing that you are worth someones time and attention. Men and women can sense when someone is confident in themselves, and this is something I think you need to work on. Realize that you are an interesting and likeable dude. You wouldn't be getting three dates with women if you weren't. First date is a feeler, is this guy normal, not going to murder me, and interesting enough that I'd want to get to know him more? You're passing this test. Second date, lets see if it wasn't a fluke and he is secretly crazy, is he still funny or was that a fluke, can he hold a more meaningful conversation, is he nice? You're passing this test, and the third date for most people is at least a, did I feel attracted to him? Did we kiss/did he make me wish we'd kissed? Any physical contact, if not I guess maybe he's not interested? You're failing this test. The good news is, once you figure this part out, I think you'll go from not getting past the third date, to 6,7,8th date territory and maybe more. It may be that this is the only hurdle you've got stopping you from having whatever it is you want when it comes to dating/relationships. Personally, I'm hung up on the 3 month mark. No date number it varies, but as 3 months approaches and things start to get serious they bail. I used to only come across as the fun/fling guy. I think I've figured out my problem and am pretty sure that with the current women I'm talking to/dating when I pick one I like I'll get past my hurdle. Hope this helped in some way and you get past yours my man. Chin up, it's a learning process!","OKCupid has a smaller userbase but it does require less effort than before.

Work on your pictures and profile and get those in tip-top shape if you want to get matches.","Tinder Plus is absolutely worth it for men. $35 for 6 months of unlimited swiping and 5 super likes a day absolutely will get you more matches because you can swipe more often than free users and super likes flat out do work if you use them on women you know you have a real shot of matching with. Tinder Gold isn't really that necessary though.\n\nI think Hinge is worth it for a month, since you get unlimited likes that way and could mass up more matches in quick fashion. There's a small enough user base that you should be able to get through most Hinge users in your area within a month, and you could get a lot of likes out there in a week's time.\n\nOKCupid, Bumble and CMB absolutely are worthless for guys as far as paid memberships go. \n\nAnd it goes without saying that girls basically shouldn't pay at all for dating apps in general. I do think Tinder Gold and Bumble Boost could be appealing to women because they let you simply swipe on everyone who liked you rather than swiping on the entire dating pool.\n\n","I think it's really useful if you spend like a couple hours swiping on a certain day because then you could conceivably swipe right on hundreds of people and should be bound to get some matches.\n\nMy favorite parts about Tinder Plus are:\n\n- 5 Super Likes each day (I'd say my match % on these is 15-20% so that alone is almost 7 matches a week, and they're higher quality matches since I thought enough of them to super like them)\n\n- Ability to change location. It's known that the algorithm gives you a slight boost when you change your location, so I change my location every day or two to get a little extra boost.\n\n- 1 boost each month. Use it on a weeknight between 9 and 10 pm, or on a Sunday near the same time. These are the highest traffic times on the app and the Boost should get you some extra matches, I've gotten anywhere from 6-10 matches per Boost.\n\nLegitimately though if you want to get more matches, sign up for Tinder Plus, fully delete and recreate your account every 2-3 weeks and spend a good 2-3 hours swiping right after creating it. Whenever I do this I usually get 20 matches within 48 hours thanks to the new user boost, then it slows to the normal 2-3 matches a day. \n\nIf you're not willing to spend $5.83/month (6 month price for Tinder Plus) to get more/better dates, then I don't know what to tell ya. I think I could get by without it in all honesty but the added value in Super Likes, Boost, Location Change and the ability to do unlimited swipes when I recreate my account make it fully worth it to me.","I get a match on 1/5 Super Likes a day pretty much, so it's totally worth it for me on Tinder Plus. If you're using 1 Super Like a day yeah, you're gonna see less results than I do, given I get 35 each week. The only relevance of a Super Like to girls is the following:\n\n* It pushes you toward the front of the girl's swiping stack. Most girls don't even know that though probably, as they don't use Super Likes. \n\n* I will admit having seen girls use the app, they usually look over your full profile a little more thoroughly if you Super Liked them.\n\nI try to use my Super Likes on girls that I have a good chance of matching with (similar attractiveness, similar interests, similar humor, lives close by, etc.), which definitely helps. Super Swipes are absolutely a waste of time, it's just an excuse to get your money. A good amount of Bumble profiles are inactive, so you may be paying $1 to Super Swipe an inactive account. Rather than paying for a single Super Swipe, just go subscribe to Tinder Plus and get the Super Likes and Boost included in the cost. ","I can definitely tell that the user base has dropped dramatically in my area. Flat out, there are less women that I'm interested in and less women in my area overall. I'd be interested to see purely male demographics, because the new messaging system was really meant to prevent women from being overwhelmed with shitty/creepy messages. Most of the complaints on this board are from men who get fewer messages back than they did previously when they could spam to everyone and their profile did more of the work than their pictures.\n\nI do think that while use of OKCupid plummeted directly after the changes, it's creeping back up a bit. I'm getting a decent amount of matches now and when I match with someone, it's a higher quality match in general. And honestly since the app opens directly to the swiping interface, girls seem to have gotten used to knowing they won't get matches unless they swipe. I find myself being more selective than I would have been had I been able to message every girl. I'd rather get fewer matches that mostly end up in at least SOME conversation. \n\nOne interesting thing I've noticed from my recent experiences is that if I message a girl before matching her, they don't message back very often. I think it's because the app is so swipe-based that girls are using it just like Tinder, where they get a match and wait for a message. They don't stop swiping just because a guy they swiped right on already messaged them, so I think that's part of the learning curve too. Because of that, now I've just moved to swiping without messaging ahead of time. It's all about adapting to how the app is working and being used. \n\nOverall, the reality is that from my experience, Tinder and/or Bumble kinda dominate the dating landscape right now and the other services are fighting for scraps.","It has been the best from my experience, at least. It has been among the most active, and has the best quality of profiles out of all of them. In ~10 years, I have used a variety of dating sites/apps including POF, Zoosk, Match, Tallfriends, Datehookup, and Bumble. Here are the annoyances I ran into with each one:\n\nBumble: I received **zero** matches despite using it for at least a month and swiping right on hundreds of profiles. Also the app showed me profiles of women who were outside of my distance range.\n\nTallfriends: There were mostly women who hadn't logged on in months/years, and few new users. Though in fairness, it is a niche dating site. Despite being a guy of only average height, I managed to get two numbers on there.\n\nZoosk: Most of the profiles looked fake. They lacked self-summaries and other forms of basic info. \n\nDatehookup: I constantly received messages/winks from bots. \n\nMatch: I received no replies after a month of being subscribed and messaging dozens of women, yet after my subscription ended, I started suspiciously getting messages.\n\nPOF: Many of the profiles and the photos that I've seen there are either trashy or just simply bad. Also when you use the \"search\" function, the same profiles may appear repeatedly, and there is no option to hide profiles. Still, POF has been the most reliable site I have used outside of OKC, and I got a few dates from it.\n\nIf I were you, I would still use OKC, but stop paying. You've paid for premium membership, but still see a lack of results. Even if you don't pay, you can still message whoever you want, and you can find out who you receive likes/messages from by using DoubleTake. ","It just depends. I'm getting more \"likes\" than I used to, but that's inflated because of the change to swiping. I actually really enjoy the new OKCupid system, because I've never had much trouble finding dates on Tinder. I also don't have to go around peppering girls with matches. Now I just wait to message girls until they like me back. Just counted and I've gotten 27 matches over the past 4 weeks, 13 of which replied back and I got 3 dates out of it. I'm fairly pleased with that. I'm really picky when it comes to OKCupid, because I'm given more information. I can see up front if someone is super religious, sex-negative, wants kids, etc, and not match them.\n\nI'd say of every 10 dates I go on, 7 are Tinder, 2 are OKCupid, 1 is Hinge. And I probably average 3-4 matches a day on Tinder versus 1 a day on OKCupid. Both apps load you up with matches in the first 48-72 hours, so I restart my OKCupid and Tinder once a month at minimum and I find that helps a lot. \n\nI'm conventionally attractive, but I'm not attractive enough to get dates on Bumble, as I suffer on there but do really well on Tinder, so I barely use Bumble. Hinge is fine, I guess, and doesn't require much effort. But the girls' profiles all feel the same (\"Where can I find you at the party? Petting the dog in the corner.\" is on every profile, I swear).","Dunno if many good dating sites or apps exist now...\n\n* Nuked my POF account from orbit in 2014 because the site had some rather misandrist policies like preventing all male users from sending photos via PM because of complaints about unsolicited dick pics, plus because I got barely any replies back, had two girls I met on dates on there bail on me just a few mins after meeting me, plus because POF's layout looks uglier than MySpace circa 2005.\n\n* Stopped using Tinder because the only girls I've ever matched with either ignored my messages, instantly unmatched me for dare having the audacity to message them, or tried to phish me out of my credit card details as they were slutty spam bots. Actually, there was one genuine woman who I had a conversation with but she was Thai, lived in Bangkok and I have no clue how I even matched with her since I never changed my location.\n\n* Deleted Bumble about two years ago because I accidentally right-swiped on a (rather hot) team leader who I used to work with. I didn't want the awkwardness of her finding that out. I thought of coming back but apparently people who deactivated their accounts get blacklisted when they return to the app and don't get any further matches.\n\n* Used Match.com for about 9 months as a premium member. Didn't get any replies back from women I messaged. A lot of the ladies on there were also late 20s to mid 40s and were mainly those looking to settle down and marry someone rich/successful.\n\n* Deleted my Happn account a week ago because I got a grand total of 2 matches, despite using the app for about a year, liking every woman who I ever passed by. Happn Premium is also REALLY expensive, to the point where you're paying Match/eHarmony prices for the same kind of features you'd get on Tinder.\n\nSo based on the comments in the thread, I decided to give Coffee Meets Bagel a try. My strategy is to be more selective about who I match with rather than go on a right-swiping spree, since that apparently gets you blacklisted in a lot of apps.\n\nThought about trying Zoosk or Badoo but the negative reviews both apps got on Google Play made me want to steer the fuck away.","I definitely get fewer matches now, but I also find that I'm far more selective in my swiping under the new messaging rules. I used to send out a ton of messages and probably hear back on 1 in 3, but now I hear back from almost every match and those matches that more often turn into dates.\n\nThe new changes have taught me to really focus in on quality matches with OKCupid and other dating sites. If I want to take a more quantity-based approach, I use Tinder.","I go on one first date every few months, maybe at most once a month if I'm putting a lot of effort in.\n\nI get matches/likes pretty frequently, especially compared to my shitty first profile.  It's worth pointing out that *how you use the apps* influences *how the app presents you*.\n\nFor example, if I don't touch tinder for a week, I stop getting likes, but if I swipe around I'll get a handful of likes in a day.  Of those, I might match 2-3, and be actually interested in meeting 1.\n\nIDK what I'd rate myself.  I've got a lot going for me but I'm busy, lazy, often slow to warm up to people, and sort of a niche brand to begin with.  Abundant and low in value IDK","Here's my Self-Summary section:\n\n\"First and foremost I'm a teacher. I enjoy teaching Biology and no matter where I find myself I'm certain I will be teaching or tutoring in some capacity. Teaching is fulfilling, challenging, and enjoyable for me.\n\nIn seeking to expand my job opportunities for teaching, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology (EEOB) at Ohio State University. I'm not too far from finishing the program and hope to start applying for jobs towards the end of summer.\n\nMy personality is somewhat quirky and goofy. I not the life of the party, but I can lead a classroom discussion like a boss. Some have a fast and furious approach to life....I lean more towards a slow, serious, and conscientious approach. My approach to humor consists of puns, twisting words to a comedic effect, and sometimes exploiting the double means of words in a context. I can find sarcasm funny and occasionally use it.\n\nI enjoy nature photography (just started Flickr: SeasonofImagination), reading (Michael Connelly murder mysteries (The Burning Room, The Wrong Side of Goodbye, The Crossing, The Gods of Guilt), books about trends (The Paradox of Choice, Spark, Freaknomics, Attached, the Longevity Project), scientific articles (mostly ecology and education related), MensHealth, Psychology Today, etc.), Netflix (Most things Marvel, Parks and Rec, the Office, Hinterland, Helix, Black Books, Iliza Shlesigner, etc.), gaming (board games: Dominion, Cards Against Humanity, King of Tokyo, Spyfall 1,2, Mafia and video games, hanging out with friends, travel, snowboarding, running (I used to run marathons on a regular basis), coffee shops (Columbus Coffee Experience as well as non-chain coffee shops) and working out (Planet Fitness, almost everyday). I'm also a big fan of SNL and John Oliver.\n\nImportant Note: I'm recently divorced as of last December after a lengthy relationship (6 years, a little over 1 year of that married). I'm going to take this whole process at a snail's pace and I've been doing everything healthy I can to move on.\"\n\nAny words of wisdom? ","The mission if you choose to accept it...\"my self-summary\":\n\nI live in the moment. Sometimes that means laughing my ass off to the latest SNL skit or John Oliver episode. Other times that means popping in my headphones and jamming out to electronic dance music while reading Reddit. When I'm not in a coffee shop getting shit done (because its impossible to be productive at home and I need to get out more) I'm outdoors taking nature photos, hanging out with friends (board games, Steam games, at one point in time Pokemon Go), or on some random adventure into the great outdoors.\n\nSometimes I'm outgoing and talkative, other times I'm laid back. I enjoy nature photography, but I'm only casually committed to it. I like reading on occasion, but find myself reading more scientific articles for classes than I get time for Michael Connelly murder mysteries.\n\nI'm a nerd, but it's kinda a subtle trait. My quarks include a fascination with bubble tea (Orea Milk Bubble tea and anything with the lychee fruits), a passion for Nintendo classics (Donkey Kong, Mario Kart, Super Mario World, Secret of Mana, and the list goes on and on), an interest in 80s music and techno, aspirations to complete the Columbus Coffee Experience, and an interest any source of self-help or psychology books I can get my hands on.\n\nI'm pet-friendly having grown up with at one time five cats and three dogs among my dad and my mom's places. I'm generally drug-unfriendly unless we're talking about socially drinking alcohol.\n\nI'm here to see what's out there. It's been six years since I've wandered in the land of singleness and it seems some things have changed. I'm hoping to gain some experience even if that just means learning to be a better a communicator and doesn't result in anything beyond that.\n\nI'm recently divorced as of last December. I've put in a lot of effort to move past this and I recognize I'm not perfect, but I'll keep trying to be better. If that's a dealbreaker for you then I hope you find what you're looking for on here and don't mind being friends.","oh boy. Well, here's my best shot:\n\n* If you still have the beard, use a trimmer to make it look less unkempt. You don't have the look to support a wild man beard. It doesn't have to be short but it should look like you take pride in it. \n* Burn the first paragraph. It's not giving off the softer-ness that your second paragraph would imply. In fact, strengthen the second paragraph and provide exposition to the audience: What makes you compassionate? What are examples of being positive that a friend could point to?\n* Cut out the video game addiction section. Girls don't need to know that right off the bat. They can ask about it should it come up. Strengthen the need for structure. Example \"I've played quite a few venues as a guitarist (Horsehoe Tavern, Lee's Palace and the Rivoli) and, while it's a relaxing hobby, it's not providing the structure or pay that I'm looking for long term.\"\n* We know you like guitar. Mention it only a maximum of twice or you come off as one dimensional. Do you like analyzing music? What other aspects of music do you enjoy? \n* Your generic things in the 'I'm really good at' second need to go...except for crosswords. Try and build that up, How often do you do them? Do you do other word games?\n* If you don't have anything better than your forearms for the noticing part, just leave it blank.\n* If you do self talk, try and see if you can tie it into relieving stress for others. You can give off the 'chill artist' vibe which some girls like.\n* Cut the Religion vs Atheism line. It's not going to get you any left leaning girls and it just looks like your hiding your fedora. Instead, expand a bit on the Maple Leafs and the songs you want to learn. Some girls like sports so you might find a hockey fan or you might find a fellow musician who can recommend you something.\n* in the 'Typical Friday Night' section, cut playing guitar. We know you do. Expand on reading books such as what you read last or the one you enjoyed the most in the past year. What live show did you last see? What made you want to go? The last movie you saw, was it good?\n* EXPAND ON LIVING WITH THE GRANDMOTHER. Yes, you're unemployed but you're doing something good in that non-working time. This can play into your compassion and caring side. Do you play music for her? What music does she like? Does she think you're getting better? Big emotional points there to be had.\n* In your 'message me if' section. Where did Tennis come from? Do you enjoy it or want to learn? Cut the deep conversation because it reinforced the fedora stereotype. What other free activities would you want to do? Nature Walk? Window shopping? Gardening? Talking about history with your grandmother? All these are things girls can do with you even if they don't play guitar or an instrument.","&amp;gt; [Serious] How does one find love when they have no equality in their career, are not compulsive dick suckers, and won't completely fall for anybody who will offer them free dinner for sex, and only gets replies from trolls and armchair activits.\n\nRofl. Not literally, but almost.\n\n&amp;gt; Instead this group hosts events for the women here to \"Learn how to play video games\".\n\nThat is like downright sexist and pointless, isn't it?\n\nI haven't witnessed any gender based inequalities at my work place so far, so that's good I suppose.\n\n&amp;gt; serious stuff\n\nBelow are the broad strokes disadvantages of males and females that I perceive from my vantage point (Canada). It's implied that these lists are comparing the genders to each other, because I don't have a base case to compare them to. For example, I included \"more judged on physical appearance\" on the female list but not the male list because even though both genders have to deal with this significantly, in my opinion women do so more.\n\nFemales\n\n- more judged on relationship status\n- more judged on sexual preferences/activity\n- more susceptible to sexual violence\n- more susceptible to harassement\n- more judged on physical appearance\n- more career and salary obstacles\n- taken less seriously intellectually\n- more negative judgement for assertive behavior\n\nMales\n\n- more expectation to pay for things and take initiative\n- more expectation towards sexual performance\n- more judged for expressing emotion\n- more judged on career choice\n- more judged on choice of hobbies and interests\n- more judged on career advancement and aptitude\n\nConclusion: society's come a long way in a short period of time (women couldn't vote like 100 years ago), and hopefully the trend continues. Even though both genders face different challenges and stereotypes, in my opinion it still remains more difficult to be a woman even in well developed countries and without considering biological disadvantages like muscular strength, periods and pregnancy.\n\nAnd of course, if your sexual orientation and gender identity is more complicated than hetero male/female or you don't live in one of the more accepting countries, things can get absurdly unfair and terrible.\n","29/M/Austin\n\nI rarely post anymore but I was active Nov\\-Feb.

I'd love to get back into hiking and camping but I need to find someone who will go with me.","All the \"if they liked you s/he would...\" advice is terrible.\n\nNearly all of it is predicated on trying to read behavior like tea leaves, and making assumptions based on absolutes.\n\nI'll use myself as an example to avoid ruffling feathers (ha!). I am not a big fan of texting. Yet, sure, if somebody seemingly interesting (I'll address \"seemingly\" in the next paragraph) reaches out, sometimes I'll eagerly get into a quick back and forth. But I ain't going to sustain that pace. Sooner or later I expect to see somebody writing about me on here - the endless hand wringing, 'does he like me', on and on. You are using a proxy (texting) to measure something else (do I like you). Everyone will reply how I must have another woman lined up, you are my back up option, and on and on. Yet the reality is my interest in texting is not at all correlated with my liking a person. \n\n\"Seemingly\". You are just words on a screen to me. All the hand wringing about 'does s/he like me' when you haven't even met, or just met for drinks! I think a stable, mentally healthy person is not going to put a lot of weight on a chat on a dating app, even if it is going well. Face it - almost every single one fails. If you are currently single, every last relationship you've ever been in failed, for that matter. I don't \"like\" you now, I don't know you. I don't know you after 2-3 dates. At most you might have piqued my interest. I've had people in my life for a long time (platonic friends) before I realized it could be more. I've dated for a few months before learning this is a bad match. It takes time. But no, we have to analyze texting patterns and frequencies, every random comment, anything to assuage that gaping hole of need in our hearts. You don't know each other. Conversation flowing on the second date doesn't equal the ability and desire to build a life together which shared goals and mores. Relax! \n\nIn short, I'm a fan of attachment theory. Maybe not every aspect, but certainly the broad contours. Much of the advice on here is not coming from a secure attachment style. Some is, of course. I've noticed some people giving consistent advice coming from this viewpoint.\n\nSpeaking for myself, having gone through a long term relationship w/o a stable attachment in my partner it is now nearly a trigger point, so I'm aware I'm overstating things a bit above. But also, know this. You can't hid it. All the sadness and hand wringing comes through, not on the electrons, but the silences, the \"just joking but really serious lol\" questions - all the \"if he was really into you\" behaviors. And I run. Because it is toxic. That's unfair, because I think there is the possibility of changing styles, and early behavior can be a bit neurotic without it permeating a LTR. But, to be honest, each time I ignore it I end up getting a 4am hostile rant on how I didn't reply fast enough, or an accusation of being on a 'hunt' because my ad is still up, or a 'forget about it' because I haven't asked her out after a few emails (these examples are from the last 2 months, I've been trying to not end communications so rapidly despite misgivings). \n\nNone of this is meant to excuse boorish behavior. It is safe to conclude that a stranger who sends a dick pic doesn't consider you a nuanced being with whom they wish to discuss epistemology, ethics, and child rearing. \n\nTL;DR: 8 paragraph OP reporting every text, every throwaway phrase, every joke - stop! And responders - you can't read tea leaves. Stop! You are getting nowhere, and making yourselves anxious and unhappy, and I (nearly) guarantee the person on the other end can sense it.\n\n\nedit: so much for TL;DR. That last paragraph brings up a related point. You get what you ask for. Not in a mystical, the universe answers your prayers sense. In the pragmatic sense. So much advice to women is based on passivity and \"if he liked you...\". What's the result? Your filters reject people with a full life, with a stable attachment style, people who have a nuanced view of early dating. And it accepts people that go 'all in' after 3 texts - falling in love with an idea, not a person. The advice leans heavily on \"butterfly's\" and \"chemistry\". Also known as Oxytocin. We understand the biochemistry of love and attachment. Oxytocin fades. Sometimes it doesn't really get super strong with some people. It is NOT a predictor of long term compatibility or committed love. We have the science to back that up. Yet most of the advice on here focuses on that. \n\nWe all feel oxytocin. It's a great feeling! But I think the mature approach is to discount it - to be wary of it misleading us into something ill suited for us. For all my verbiage I do the same things - get caught up in an idea of a person, feel flustered, feel neurotic(does she like me!!?!?!) all that stuff, good and bad. We are bags of chemicals, after all, molded by millions of years of evolution to procreate. But now we want something a bit different than our biological imperatives. We are conscious, and can choose different behaviors. Choose somebody that throws themselves into you after 2 dates, well, know that oxytocin fades, and in 6 months they'll be \"just not that into you\". ","I grew up with strict, academic-focused Asian parents. From your post history I'm seeing some resemblance of how they treated you to my sister (frequent yelling into tears, physical violence, zero emotional support, encouragement, or positive reinforcement, but a punishment system that would steadily deny her everything that made her happy in an effort to motivate her grades). Your parents seemed crazier though. \n\nI was the first child that happened to figure out how to study on my own and \"make it\" to a good college, so clearly they thought the parenting style was effective for my poor sister.\n\nMy point of advice is to accept that *neither of us* will ever meet our parents' expectations. I am, by many metrics, *very successful*, but my parents still think I'm a lazy, socially awkward loser without a girlfriend. And I deal with occasional bouts of incredible self-deprecation and low self-esteem. My parents were wrong and if I ever have children I will do everything in my power to make sure I'm not like my parents.\n\nI'm not really sure what was going on with your now ex-boyfriend, because I don't see anything wrong with the three things in your post. 1) is an instance of insecurity, which every human has and typically shares with a partner, 2) is cute and 3) is a plus in my book.\n\nIt's important not to ruminate on reasons that it could be your own fault. I do this to myself all the time, but you should be picking yourself up. \n\n\"So when you get rejected, the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp.

The arbitrary 3 date rule\n\nSo, true or not, a lot of people think the third date is the sex date. Having to meet with you twice before sex really isn’t a deterrent to people looking for a warm body. Really the only foolproof way to tell if someone is looking for one time sex is if they disappear after you sleep with them.\n\nDo post-sex fades make you feel super shitty? It’s a fine balance between wanting to establish sexual chemistry early and wanting to protect your feelings. And it’s okay to wait until a stronger emotional connection is established.\n\n2. Your insecurity \n\nI know how it feels to feel that way, but your worth is comprised of *so* many more things than having a partner. An individual not wanting to date you doesn’t mean that you’re not attractive or kind or smart or funny or whatever your particular fear is. It means that the compatibility or chemistry or timing isn’t right with one individual.\n\n3. Comparing your first time with a new partner to established sex with your ex.\n\nOne or both of you might be nervous, your bodies might not respond like you’d want it to, you don’t know the in’s and out’s of what your partner likes yet, you don’t have that emotional intimacy yet, etc.. \n\nAlmost no one is at their best the first time and comparing it to long term sex with your ex isn’t gonna do you or your partners any favors.","Yes, no matter what is my answer. No matter what I'm doing, I can find a way to send a text, even if it's \"Heading into a meeting, I'll text you back in full after!\" I expect my partner can provide the same considerations.\n\nI definitely want to be texting with my S.O. throughout the day. Even if it's minute stuff like how each other's days are going, there's always plenty to talk about with that special person. Texting all day has never detracted from me being able to talk in person. I'm really chatty and if someone doesn't text me throughout the day on a daily basis, I'm probably not gonna date them. My last ex was an incredible texter and it made me really happy throughout the day. I couldn't go without that again. ","&amp;gt; SHOW INTEREST. It seems like a no-brainer, but apparently that’s not the case. It’s insane how few guys even initiate conversation or try at all in the beginning. It’s like they figure there’s always something better around the corner, so whatever. Either pursue me and make your intentions clear or get away from me.\n\nI don't want to say anything unless I feel you'll react positively to it, plus I don't automatically assume that women being nice to me are into me, so I keep my mouth shut for fear of looking like an idiot. And the whole \"chase me\" thing is a stupid game you can't win. Stop chasing someone, \"you're boring and not willing to fight for what you want, go away!\" Keep chasing someone, \"no means no, asshole, this is harassment, go away!\" I will agree with you on making your intentions clear from the start - hanging around someone and hoping they'll read your mind and feel the same way is a recipe for disaster - but it works both ways.\n\n&amp;gt; TALK TO ME. Have an actual, legitimate conversation with me. Get to know me. Make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. Don’t send me two texts and then ghost. I don’t want to waste another minute of my time on something that’s going absolutely nowhere. Either act interested or don’t bother in the first place.\n\nI don't want to waste my time either. I don't want to invest in anyone unless I feel like it'll actually go somewhere. I can ask you the deepest philosophical questions there are, but if all you give me are curt, one-word answers then I assume you're not interested.\n\n&amp;gt; CALL ME. No one calls anyone anymore, and it drives me insane. If you’re trying to ask someone out, you should call that person. End of story. I don’t want to be asked out over text, or even worse, online. That means you didn’t even make the effort to get my phone number.\n\n I can't read your mind to figure out how *you* want to be asked out. Plus times have changed, this is the era of texting and apps, maybe you should lower your standards and join the rest of us in the 21st century.\n\n&amp;gt; ASK ME OUT. For real. Over the phone. On a date. Don’t ask me to hang out, or chill, or whatever people are saying these days. I’m not that girl. I want someone who appreciates me as a person and wants to take me on a real date. If you’re too lazy to do so, then lose my number. I don’t need you to take me somewhere fancy, but at least put some thought into it.\n\nSee previous.\n\n&amp;gt; SHUT UP ABOUT YOURSELF. You finally get to a first date, and he spends the entire time jabbering away about his own life and problems. I didn’t sign up to be your therapist, dude. Reality check: this doesn’t show how open and vulnerable you are. It shows how narcissistic, self-absorbed, and insecure you are. I want to get to know you, obviously, but we’re never going to work out if you don’t spend some time listening to me, too.\n\nYou want me to, as per point 2, have an actual, legitimate conversation with you, get to know you, make an effort to see if we get along and if we’re compatible. So you want me to ask all about you, but you don't want to ask at all about me? A conversation takes two people, lady, and you're presumably trying to find out about me just as much as I'm trying to find out about you. Maybe you should shut up for a while and learn about me. Just because I reveal things about myself doesn't mean I think you're my therapist.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW SOME RESPECT. I am a strong and independent woman. I don’t want a guy to be intimidated by me. I do want a man to respect me as an equal and treat me as such. My independence definitely doesn’t mean you get to abandon your manners and courtesy. I want someone who still opens doors, pulls out chairs, and gets up on the subway to give an older person his seat. No respect, no date.\n\nYou're \"strong\" and \"independent\" and \"want a man to respect me as an equal\", but you still want me to open doors for you, pull out your chair for you, etc? So you want me to treat you like a dainty flower that can't do anything for herself. Or you want me to treat you like royalty. That's not equality either way, that's treating you with exceptionalism. I'd respect you more if you could at least admit that.\n\n&amp;gt; THINK OF INTERESTING DATES. If you’ve actually talked to me and taken some time to get to know what I like, you can do better than the overdone \"dinner and a movie\" date. If you haven’t, I don’t want to go out with you anyway. When I plan our dates, I’m going to be creative, and I expect the same from you.\n\nI'm sure there are better date ideas than dinner and a movie, but I also don't want to date someone that expects to be impressed with something novel each time. All I'm hearing from this point is \"entertain me\". And you talk about when you plan dates, but I've got a feeling that you actually expect *me* to do all the planning and setting up the arrangements. This makes you sound very high maintenance, and I personally am not into that.\n\n&amp;gt; COMPLIMENT ME. Strong, independent women still want to be complimented. Every woman likes hearing that she’s pretty, funny, intelligent, and wonderful. This problem baffles me more than anything else. It’s so easy to pay a compliment, and yet most men simply don’t bother. WTF?\n\nI have no objections to this one.\n\n&amp;gt; TREAT ME WELL. I will treat you well, but I want to know that you’ll do the same as well. I’ve been in too many situations where I was a great girlfriend to a terrible boyfriend. I’m wary of going there again, so sorry — you’re going to have to prove yourself.\n\nI question how \"great\" a girlfriend you were and how \"terrible\" your boyfriends were given how narcissistic you sound so far, but it's a common enough feeling that I'll take your word for it. It boils down to the conundrum with dating in general - neither of us wants to invest in the other until we're sure the other won't disappoint us. I expect you to prove yourself to me just as much as you expect me to prove myself to you. At some point we're going to have to trust each other, otherwise one of us is moving on.\n\n&amp;gt; CONSIDER MY FEELINGS. Yes, this is a component of a mature relationship. You have to think about someone besides yourself. You can’t just make whatever decision you want without thinking about whether it might hurt me. This means you need to tell me if you’re seeing other people, and you can’t just spout insensitive crap out of your mouth. All I ask is that you’re a considerate human being.\n\nAre you going to consider my feelings in return? And if I accidentally say something you perceive as insensitive, are you going to let me know so that I can learn not to say it again? Or are you going to go cold on me and not communicate with me?\n\n&amp;gt; UNDERSTAND THAT I’M WORTH IT. I can’t date any more men who don’t put in any effort. I know that I’m worthy of a great guy, and it drives me crazy that so many jerks don’t see it. Obviously they aren’t the right men for me, but I’m so tired of waiting around for one who is. When is someone going to man up and decide he wants me for his own?\n\nSo far you seem to define \"effort\" as \"someone who will show their entire hand to me without seeing any of my cards\". You want a guy to pursue you, treat you like a queen, and act completely invested in you, all without any show of promise that you'll do likewise for them. Maybe you keep dating men who don't appear to put in any effort because you're not putting in any effort? It's a two-way street, lady.\n\n&amp;gt; SHOW ME YOU CARE. I’m pretty chill, but don’t treat me like one of your bros. Make at least little gestures to show that you’re interested and that you appreciate me as a person. It can be as small as a sweet, lingering kiss or brushing my hair away from my face. Just some little way of showing you care is always appreciated.\n\nEveryone expresses their love and affection in different ways. Either learn to recognize someone's style, or just ask them for the type of affection that you want. And why would I give someone I just met a lingering kiss or brush their hair away? That's getting too far into someone's personal space too soon. It takes time to build that sort of affection and trust.\n\n&amp;gt; TRY YOUR BEST. I’m not asking for perfection here. Just make a little effort, and I’ll be happy. What drives me insane are all the guys who simply don’t try at all. It’s extremely upsetting and frustrating. I’m starting to feel like it’s me, but I refuse to lower my standards just because men don’t seem to be capable of meeting them.\n\nI somehow doubt you're not looking for perfection, or that you'd actually be satisfied with someone putting in a \"little\" effort. But at least you've got some self-awareness.\n\n&amp;gt; CHALLENGE ME. Talk to me. Ask me deep questions. Find out what makes me tick. I want to connect on a deeper level, and I want someone who is all about doing that, too. Help make me want to be the best I can be every single day. There’s no point for me to bring another person into my life unless we’re going to benefit each other.\n\nThis is just a rehash of a few of the above points and requires no further rebuttal.\n\n&amp;gt; CONNECT WITH ME. I’m not looking for some surface BS, so if that’s all you want, let me know upfront. Don’t try to trick me into thinking you want more so you can get laid. I’m so done with that sneaky, dishonest behavior. Either put effort into what we have, or don’t even bother starting anything with me.\n\nSee previous.\n\nMost of this can be condensed into \"I don't want to invest in someone unless they've invested in me\". Fair enough, I'm sure it's a universal condition, but the entire thing as worded comes off as entitled. The only line it was missing was \"are there any good men out there still?\"\n\ntldr; I put way too much effort into this.","* Lack of reciprocating interest (If I don't text them for a week, we don't talk. I have to make all the plans or else there's no date)\n* Having kids, Smoking, or Socially conservative politics. (As long as it's liberal social policy I don't mind fiscal conservatism)\n* being a passive participant in the conversation (not asking any questions, not trying to lengthen the conversation by adding in a funny story)\n\nI ghosted a girl recently because I literally had to ask that she ask me a question to get to know me. She replied quickly to any question I asked but made no effort to have a conversation. Answered the question: That's it. Example: \"What's your favorite genre or band? Rock.\" \"How was your day today? Good.\" I had to open up OKC to see what her name was and what I asked her because she was that forgettable.","I don't like it because I can't tell if someone's a creeper just from a quick glance at their profile. I either have to \"like\" people fairly indiscriminately to leave myself open to conversation, or I have to close doors on potential conversation that could be worthwhile. I was doing just fine having the block feature, or simply not responding to people who weren't worth my time.\n\nI also hate hate hate that they just deleted 17 years worth of conversations between me and other people on their platform. I wanted to retain those, whether they were good or bad, because they were a history of my experience. Luckily, I was able to find a script to download it all into a text file before they wiped it out, but that should have been something offered by OKC.\n\nI think offering the message filtering feature as an option would have been the way to go. I realize that some other folks have triggers for PTSD and this feature would be a boon to them. There are also plenty of other people who don't, who still prefer the change. They could utilize it if they wanted. Leave the rest of us alone.\n\nThe changes that have been made since OKC was purchased by match.com have pissed me off. I don't trust them to do right by me at all anymore, and that's a terrible feeling when you know they have a boatload of personal data about your perspectives and thoughts. ","I am a woman, albeit an older one so we have an entirely different experience than our younger sisters...but OKC is essentially useless -I do fine connecting -matches, conversations and dates- on Tinder and Bumble, and my experience has not changed  like it has on OKC (so no I did not get uglier) . Not only am I barely receiving messages anymore, but I have not had a single outgoing one responded to -not something that I experience on Bumble or Tinder. Granted I am only active on OKC a day or so every several weeks before I deactivate again but the last 10-15 messages I have sent...ZERO replies.  So I don't know what population this is working for. ","&amp;gt;It's really tough to keep my head up and have self-worth and self-esteem through all of this. \n\nIt's really hard when we get obscure feedback from a system that may or may not be reflecting our desirability from people we find interesting. The way to get around this is to recognize (a) online dating is not representative of our desirability and (b) our ability—or lack thereof—to find love is not an indicator of our inherent worth.  \n\nI highly recommend you (and basically everyone on this sub struggling) check out /r/selfcompassion or read up on the practice. It sounds a little wooey or hippie-dippy, but goddamn do I find it a refreshing way to not let dating get me down. And in other aspects of life, I just feel good about myself and others (note: this is different than forced positivity, which is creepy and won't work in the long run). \n\n&amp;gt;Do any of you share my feeling that these apps only worsened your feelings of self-worth and your self-esteem? \n\nAbsolutely. We're immersed in an environment where everyone is exceedingly picky, and only a fraction of who we are is put on display to the judgment of others. \n\n&amp;gt;How difficult is it to continue to coach yourself and tell yourself that you're worth loving and keep your head up because tomorrow is a new day with new opportunities?\n\nIt's simple. Not necessarily easy, but it's simple. There are certain exercises you can do to rebuild your sense of self-worth. Neff's book on Self-Compassion (you can download it on your Kindle) is highly valuable for exactly these sorts of questions. ","I don't care who messages first.  It rubs me the wrong way if I just get a \"hey\" first message, but honestly if she's sufficiently attractive I don't care.\n\nReasons I get a match and don't message:\n\n* I'm lazy\n* On second thought I'm not that attracted to her\n* I'm burnt out\n* I don't have time to meet anyways in the future\n* I can't think of anything to write in the span of about one minute, so I give up and tell myself I'll try again later (I won't)\n\n\"Hey I like your face\"\n\n\"Let's bone\"\n\nOr more seriously just asking about one of my hobbies or just \"hey how's your week\" is fine.  Really the ideal conversational partner on an app like OkC shows enough interest to get the ball rolling and keep some momentum on it -- doesn't really matter what she says.\n\nThat's a really long winded way of saying \"she puts effort in to keep the conversation flowing\"","Yes. List? Done.\n1. Asking a girl out on a second date when I knew I wasn't interested because she was really eager and I was too polite to say no, then doing some kissing on that date, then telling her on new years eve eve (30th) over text I wasn't interested 'in that way' (because I wanted her to feel free to kiss whoever at midnight).\nI feel guilty about this all the time. It was me trying to rebound because I thought that's what you're meant to do after a huge breakup, but I felt gross the whole time and I wasn't ready for something and I knew it. I wish I was more blunt with her. And I did apologise weeks later. But it still leaves a bad feeling in my heart.\n\n2. I was that guy who was getting clearly ghosted, but did not realise it at the time. I feel bad for being so stupid, I'm sure I came off so needy at that point!\n\n3. Asking the girl I loved to not talk to me about her planned tattoo because I don't like tattoos. I know I had no right to protest against it, so I just didn't want to talk about it. Now I know that's protest enough, and a sucky thing I did, and a huge regret. It wasn't what caused the break-up, but it's definitely the point I think she stopped loving me. The break-up had to happen, but I wish it wasn't like that. \n\n4. I just have a lot of dates where I've read the room and she wanted a cuddle or smooch and I thought \"nah it's too soon\" and wondered why they lost interest days later. I was a wussy young adult. \n\nWow, this list makes me sound horrible. I swear I'm a lovely young chap most of the time!","Dear Diary,\n\nI moved to Denver almost exactly 8 months ago. Some parts of the move have been great, but moving away from the place I've lived basically forever has been really hard. I've only made a couple of more\\-than\\-acquaintance friends here, and still nothing on the level of actually get invited to shit that doesn't directly involve me. Dating has mostly been a massive slog with matches being few and far between compared to pre\\-move. I also just kind of feel like a boring person who isn't bringing much to the table \\- I don't know the cool things to do in town, I don't know the best places to go, and I have no friends group to bring people along with.\n\nThe one girl I dated through the winter dumped me and it hit me pretty hard. She was basically everything I was looking for and I'm definitely still hung up on it. I'm sure I wouldn't be dwelling on it so much if I wasn't feeling so kinda socially lost generally and not having great dating success. Definitely did a dumb thing and purposefully ran into her at the gym for the first time since we broke up. I've just had a kind of visceral feeling of loneliness in the back of my chest for the last month and not sure how to deal with it. \n\nAnyway not sure what the point of all this was. I'm actually feeling pretty alright today. I've been going on first dates, I signed up for a couple of coed soccer leagues that start in June and that can't come fast enough. Ramble over","It's really shitty that you're experiencing this. I've experienced this exact thing A LOT and it gets exhausting. What she's doing is basically demanding/expecting you to do all the emotional labor of maintaining and cultivating a connection. That's rough. I'm sorry. \n\nMy advice (and what I've done in the past) is to call her out on it. Gently and with kindness, but say something like \"I notice you haven't asked me questions about me or tried to get to know me. What are you interested in learning about me?\"\n\nWhen I've done this, it hasn't always gone well. Some get defensive, or apologetic. Some realize what's happening and start making more of an effort. My best relationships though are with people who do this automatically and I've not had a good, satisfying relationship with someone who doesn't know how to take an interest in the other person... so, YMMV. I wish you good luck though.\n\nSidenote: Honestly, I always thought that this behavior was just sort of standard male-conditioning. The vast majority of the dates I've been on with men were men talking about themselves, and never asking me questions about me or my life.  I am assuming that you are male, and your post is saying you're getting this behavior from a woman, so I just want to say thank you for sharing. Disrupting a stereotype in my brain that I didn't really know I was holding onto is good. So, thank you.","I’M ANNOYED BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I GOT PAID ON FRIDAY I DONT HAVE ACCESS TO MY MONEY. SWITCHED BANKS, DON’T HAVE A DEBIT CARD YET, IT’S NOT A TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR BANK SO I CAN’T WALK INTO A BRANCH AND GET CASH. MY CAR IS ON E AND I HAVE A 45 MINUTE DRIVE HOME. FUUUUUCK.\n\nOn another note, I’m frustrated with dating. Waaaahhh! I had two great dates with two separate guys two weeks ago. The second guy had even texted the next morning saying how much fun he had and we set up a tentative date for last Thursday. Thursday comes and he said nothing. I didn’t want to bring it up to look desperate so I just haven’t texted. I kinda liked him. I’m so bummed. I’ve been wallowing in my sadness for the last few days. \n\nAnd I have a massive migraine and no medicine. Why no medicine??? Because I literally have not one dollar on me. Oh and my wallet was lost in January and instead of getting new replacement credit cards I just went ahead and canceled them...moron. \n\nToday sucks. ✌��","No.\n\nI'm a fairly attractive woman, but I have not had an easy or fun time online dating. I've been doing it since I was 22 and in 3 different cities now. A lot of my messages go unanswered or they stop responding. And 90% of the first dates I go on are weirdos or unattractive people that I tried to go in \"without any expectations\". On the rare occasion that I do actually meet someone attractive that I feel I get along with, they usually aren't interested after anything between 1-5 dates. My longest \"relationship\" was 2 months.\n\nI don't identify with the people that say it's so much easier for women, or attractive women in particular. The only difference in my opinion is an inbox filled with gross \"hey sexy, wanna hook up?\" messages instead of bots.","Procrastination coupled with ADHD(unmedicated). If I'm not interested/motivated enough, it gets left to last minute. Working mostly evenings and weekends means my social life is lacking at times \n\nIf I'm in the zone, especially if it's something that I want to be doing, you're gonna have a hard time pulling me away. Have had those moments like with Photoshop sessions where I'm there for 3+ hours and I feel like I've been at it for 30 minutes. Probably not the healthiest thing cause I've neglected sleep/food on occasion from that.","I actually did, and I think it went fairly well.  I'll message tomorrow and get a feel for if she's interested in doing something again.\n\n  Not doing first dates at Italian restaurants again though, I like my last coffee date that cost a total of $5.  I'm just glad today was payday to take the sting out of it.\n\nI've been getting tired of online dating and I'm thinking of trying to meet women at bars.  That would have been unthinkable for me a couple of months ago, but I've been getting a bit more confident about this whole process and I think I'll give it a shot.\n","Water, because I don't really like drinking alone, and because I don't really have anything else to drink but kind of wish I did because the guy I've been on 2 dates with just texted me to let me know he's sorry, but he's not seeing anything long term here and doesn't want to waste my time, which is fine because I wasn't really feeling it either and it's nice that he chose to do that instead of fade (though a fade would've been fine in this case), but you know...sometimes I get so tired of going on first dates and just want to feel settled into something and relaxed and comfortable with someone.","Friday: an old friend from way back in high school is coming back to town, so we are going to hang out and probably grab some sushi.  \n\n\nSaturday:  A friend of mine is celebrating her birthday with breakfast and mimosas, so I'm going to do that.  Final Four games will be on as well, so I'll probably hit up a bar with my dad to watch them.  \n\nSunday: Relax and catch up on some reading. ","I would suggest that you give yourself a nice long break from dating. Set yourself a timeframe of maybe a year which is just going to be your 'me time'. \n\nFrom your comments below I gather that you manage to exercise, eat well and dress nicely but you are currently unemployed? I would suggest that this is job one of your self improvement goals. I would personally not date someone who was not in employment or full time education even if he literally looked like a younger, more athletic George Clooney and sent me a really funny personalised opening message. Outside of dating having a decent job will help improve your self esteem and knowing you will be able to take care of yourself financially over the long term regardless of whether or not you ever find a partner really makes you feel safe.\n\nI don't think that you should stop eating healthily or exercising because both of these things are good for you and will pay off in a lot more areas of life than just dating. You should also consider therapy if you are generally unhappy with your life.\n\nWhile you are on your 'me time' year off you should also try to find yourself a few hobbies that you really enjoy, preferably that you can do with other people (Meetup groups are great). Also, try to vary the stuff that you do when your friends are all busy. Movies, parks, museums, concerts. \n\nThe idea is to build a life where you could still be happy (even if slightly less happy) if the romance thing never works out for you.\nIf and when you feel that this describes you then this is the right time to start dating.","Still bummed.\n\nI texted him last friday (over a week ago) that he could come and get his stuff 'whenever'. And he replied that he would let me know when he would... still hasn't. I'm still using his spotify. And sometimes it's clear he's letting me use it, especially during workouts, because he'll start listening less than a minute after I stop.\n\nFriday I booty called a guy that once featured heavily in my STS stories for a while. He was flattered but has a girlfriend. Embarrassing, but oh well. I was relieved because I'm not sure I really wanted to go through with it anyway.\n\nI had another first date Saturday with an Indian engineer. It was super short because I had an awful headache, and i finally just told him that and he was really sweet about it. I honestly don't feel anything for him, and it makes me feel like shit because I want to be able to like other guys other than my ex.\n\nI'm probably going to ask my ex to meet me tomorrow somewhere to chat and give back his stuff. We'll see how that goes. ","Had a second date with my liberal army vet engineer cutie last night and I think it was nice? We went to a barcade and he broke the skee ball machine and we had fun, but it ended kind of awkwardly (we hugged but he didn't try to kiss me or anything, and when we got to my car he just said \"so that's it?\" and didn't suggest doing anything else or try to make a move so like...what else is there?

Also, a guy who faded on me in November after a really good date accidentally added me on Snapchat last night (and then deleted the request) but it didn't stop me from being a bitter asshole about it and texting him \"how awkward.\"\n\nAnother guy who lives ~80 miles away who sometimes comes and buys me dinner and drinks and makes out with me who I haven't talked to in a few months popped up on Tinder yesterday and I want to text him but I'm being ridiculous and don't know what to say.\n\n2018 is weird so far.","Sunday night the guy I dated over a year ago invited me over to watch the new Cloverfield movie and it was so powerfully bad, but we cuddled and drank rosé and made out and maybe did more than that and then slept next to each other and it was nice.\n\nI ended up matching with the farmer I wanted to dm on Instagram so saved some embarrassment there, and we got drinks on Friday. It was…mediocre? Not great? And only lasted an hour. He started talking about his housemates and then when he told me his roomie’s cat’s name I was just like “…oh shit” but honestly it’s a common enough name that I was just being paranoid, so I tried to let it slide but kept thinking that he’s probably roommates with the last guy I went out with a couple times, and how maybe that’s why he said I looked familiar when I first got to the bar, and how he was probably going to go home and bring it up and they’re going to think this is a thing that I planned or something and it made me want to die a little. He was nice but he talked about himself a lot and didn’t ask me many questions and I caught him checking his phone enough times that I felt like he was mentally checked out, so I got quiet and felt even more awkward. When we were leaving I asked if the cat wears bowties and he says “yeah! I’ll send you a picture” but doesn’t even ask why I might know that. \n\nMy bartender tinder match got mad and said that I negged him last night because my friend and I thought mint was a weird choice for her tropical drink but we liked it and I would have forgiven him anyway because he called me “dear.”\n\nI’m just…tired of online dating because I feel like everyone (including me) thinks there has to be an immediate spark right away or it’s not worth it at all and you shouldn’t give it another shot, also I’m tired of awkward first dates and I haven’t had anything nice happen in a long time but I still can’t figure out what it is I’m doing wrong, and I don’t want to deal with it anymore. I think I need to take a real break and focus on other things until I actually feel mentally ready to dive back in and I’m not just doing it because I want an ego boost or because I feel lonely or whatever. I don't know what I'm going to fill the time with yet but hopefully something good. Maybe I'll run more after work and read more and start trying out new recipes, and start taking myself on dates. ","I had a date last night with a guy from tinder. He looked different from his pics. he's tall, great conversationalist but here's the main problem - he has a double chin. I'm still talking to him because I don't want to be the asshole who doesn't date someone who's otherwise great because they have a double chin, but I don't know if i can get past it.\n\nWas supposed to have a date today with a wrestler but he ended up having a bad headache and canceling, which is great because I saw the incredibles and got wine drunk with a friend.\n\nAlso I reached out to my ex last sunday and we talked for about 4 hours before he stopped replying again. So, awesome.","Oh I'm the first one? Cool\n\nSo ex did not get his stuff. Monday I dropped it off at his door, texted him it was there. He thanked me and apologized for not doing it himself. Whatever, asshole.\n\nFriday night I had a date with a 33 year old. And it went hilariously wrong. So he picked a super nice sushi restaurant. I get there, parking is shit so I had just given my key to the valet when he texted 'sorry I can't make it, something came up at work.' Obviously I'm pissed, the valet people are super nice and don't make me pay and I drive home. I'm almost home when I get a text 'I can be there in 20 minutes.' \n\nSo I texted him that if he really wasn't standing me up, we could get ice cream in like an hour. So that's what we did, but it's clear he couldn't recover from his fuckup. He was super awkward and also complained about his boss a lot. I did enjoy talking to him and we had things in common, but he lives pretty far away (45 min+). It's funny because he must have asked me for a second date 5 times, but never texted me after. \n\nI'm still talking to the indian engineer but we didn't see each other this weekend either, so its been 2 weeks. I texted him to see if he wanted to hang out soon because i don't know why we're still talking if not. \n\nWas supposed to have a date with a guy on tinder, who asked me for a photo to prove I wasn't going to catfish. I said I would do it but I wasn't catfishing, and he disappeared after that? And another guy on bumble flaked after asking for a date too. \n\nI hate online dating. ","Had a third 'date' with indian engineer. Basically was the same as the 2nd date. Saw a movie, barely talked, hugged, and he left for a friend's birthday party.\n\nI decided to take a break over the weekend from dating apps but continued to get messages from previous swipes. A tinder guy reemerged with the excuse that he had missed my messages since he didn't check the app and didnt get notifications, an excuse he already used once. But he did text me his phone #. Idk, i probably won't message.\n\nWas talking to a cute guy on the league who set his location as close to mine so of course he lives 40 minutes away.

If the guy was just a friend then I would definitely be mentioning it because, well, it's probably the biggest thing that has happened in your life since you last saw him and it would be weird not to. \n\nI would try to tell him in an upbeat way and mention that you are not worried because you got 6 weeks notice, have savings and will get severance.\n\nIf I was dating someone who had this happen to them I would be ok with it. I would stop being ok with it if:\n\n1. He suggested that I should start paying for him because of his circumstances. The relationship is far too new for him to be relying on me financially.\n2. He became depressed and his personality changed. Again, the relationship is too new for him to expect me to be his shoulder to cry on. If you do start to feel crappy about the situation then lean on old friends or family members for support not your new potential boyfriend\n3.

I thought he was really quirky/artsy but I realize now that he is on the autism spectrum. We didn't really hit it off. He never left from last night.

I did manage to snag a job, but it's going to be 12 hour night shifts every other week. I'm just feeling really sad because how am I supposed to date with that schedule? Who would put up with that? My ex would have, but of course that's out of the picture.\n\nI did go out on a date last night, just to prove I can. He was fine, it wasn't a terrible date. But I wasn't attracted and I haven't messaged him at all today. The only guy I want is my ex. And speaking of my ex, he won't get his stuff from my place. So I sent him a text Friday saying something like 'you can get your stuff whenever' which was I thought, a clear hint to get it NOW. But no, he just said 'alright i'll let you know when i'll do that'. WTF get your shit. ","Yes.\n\nBe direct.  Know the answers to questions like “are you ok not having children of your own” before they get asked.  Don’t treat them like they’re damaged.\n\nIt’s probably a red flag if they talk about their ex a lot.  I have no evidence to support this wild speculation.\n\nBurned how?\n\nDont listen to them.  Your friends and family are just trying to corner the divorcee market for themselves.  ","I have heard many people say that the past is the past, but I personally like to know someone's history. It allows me to have a better idea of what their own journey has been and where they are coming from. \n\nI do not need to know all the details, but if I want to be sensitive to the needs of my partner and if there are things they have learned about themselves in past relationships that they need today to make them happy, I want to know them. A lot of that can come out of learning about what someone's experiences have been with others. Plus, I think it is healthy to be able to talk about such an intimate topic and can create a bit of a bond between two people to be able to open up like that.","I became friends with my friend's brother. She moved overseas and we lost touch but I kept hanging out with him. Eventually we hooked up. We sleep together occasionally, and have been doing so for a couple years now... But if one of us is ever in a relationship or just doesn't feel like having sex, we spend time together as friends with no awkwardness or weird tension. \n\n\nI think it works because while we're good friends and have great sex, we're not compatible as romantic partners. Neither of us has caught feelings or is hoping for more. Occasionally we talk about it just to check in that we're on the same page.\n\n\nJust to speak to your situation... Please don't think too much about what other people believe is normal or appropriate. We seem to like to pigeonhole relationships and set boundaries based off societal influence that may not work for a given situation. If you enjoy what you're doing with your friend, you're both happy, and there's open communication, then who cares what some bystander thinks? It's none of their business.","I think the important thing is to ask **why** you're throwing in those extra criteria.\n\nI'm an instinctual-type, so I don't really set a firm yes/no dichotomy for things I want and things I avoid. I simply get a feeling from the first two hours. *However*, I've been asked to articulate what I'm looking for, and I realized that what many fix as requirements are exactly what you call them, \"shortcuts.\"\n\nFunny? I'm looking for someone with a similar personality. If they don't make me laugh in the first month, they may just not know me well enough to be comfortable cracking a joke not appreciated by most. If we're getting along, funny can wait.\n\nEducated? What I'm looking for is someone that isn't left staring blankly when I get excited about the latest science article I read, or geek out over Kerbal Space Program and Thrust-to-Weight Ratios and gravity turns. Or when I talk about the history of the concept of nations, the first ironclads in 1590 that the West generally ignores, or how the U.S. won WWII in Europe with math because their person in charge of infantry doctrine during the interwar period was an idiot. Rather than \"educated,\" I'm looking for someone who gets interested in these kinds of things, rather than spacing out. Hell, plenty of \"educated\" individuals still blank out, leaving me irritated. Really what I want is someone intellectually inquisitive.\n\nSimilar race? Again, I'm really looking for someone that has seeks to have a family, but not equally strong religious beliefs. I can search for that just fine.\n\nGood career? I want someone that has real interests and won't just waste away at home all day. Obviously, if they can contribute financially, that's overwhelmingly preferred, but as long as they're carrying their own weight, I don't think I'd mind terribly if they had a part-time job to pay for their own expenses while they threw time and effort into a business venture in a field they loved.\n\nI will say that some things should be made non-negotiable. Kind, for example. It's okay to be a jerk in jest (read: funny, light-hearted troll), but not on the first date, and not all the time. Responsible is another, because you want to be in love, not be a parent.\n\nBut if you track down the rest to their roots, maybe you can find them in other places than where you've been looking.","&amp;gt;She asked \"how long ago was your divorce, What do you think the causes of the divorce?\"\n\nSo I'm an open book, and generally when people ask this question they want to see if people are willing to acknowledge their own complicity in a relationship ending vs trash-talking their ex.\n\nBecause really, your answer is going to tell them a lot about you as a person.","I would recommend 3 topics of discussion on every first date: 1) what are your attitudes towards monogamy and exclusivity, 2) how do you define safe sex, 3) how do you know what you want from a prospective partner and what's your preferred way to communicate that with them?\n\nNone of these have to be about you and these are likely questions she hasn't been asked before but she should have a pretty clear idea of her feelings on the first two. If she struggles with the third, you can offer your own answer.\n\nBy broadcasting early that you're interested in having these kinds of discussions you are laying the groundwork for other discussions down the road.","As someone else said, you're being brash, reckless and tactless and playing it off as \"Honesty\". None of them asked for that information, so there's no need to disclose it. For all you know, they all have other partners too. The only way I'd bring up seeing other people (unless I was asked to tell them directly in a FWB situation), is if I'm bringing up exclusivity. You ESPECIALLY shouldn't bring up the other people you're seeing when you've only been seeing each other for a week or two!\n\nYour actions honestly are so brash that it almost reeks of you using \"honesty\" as a method of pushing these girls away before you can get too close to them. I only say that because I noticed similar behavior in myself once upon a Time and I really think that was why I did it. Do you really want something monogamous? Or are you enjoying being single/non-monogamous more? I can't answer that one, do some real thinking on that.\n\nFocus on enjoying your time with whoever you're with, let things play out naturally, and don't talk about your dating life in front of other people you're seeing currently. And DEFINITELY don't be answering them while you're on other dates. Give whoever you're with your full attention.\n\n","I agreed to go out with this guy that looked exactly like a 90's Ben Afleck. I was feeling pretty full of my self until....this man showed up 8 inches shorter, 75 pounds heavier, rotting teeth and bald. When this guy approached me at the coffee shop and started chatting I was like \"oh, um hey, nice to say hello, but I am meeting a date\" and he was \"I am your date\". That was without a doubt the best catfish I ever came across. I was so blown away I stayed for my whole coffee, mostly because I knew it would make a good story. ","Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.\n\nEdit: But really I just let being bullied make me socially awkward and didn't realize that I'm pretty awesome until I turned 30 despite hitting most of the social \"success\" milestones. But that wasn't the parents' fault so meh.\n\nI mean I got to go to Space Camp. Never had fancy clothes, but first rate opportunities.\n\nSecond edit: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger. Who knew Dr. Evil was the path to Reddit success?","Meh, nothing really, life just went on and I guess I became more attractive as I got older. I always strived to be my best and once I got into grad school and was on a clear career path more women found the scientist stuff cool. Before that being the funny dorky friend was just it. Now it seems I’m the funny dorky guy with a cool job. It doesn’t fit everyone, but I at least actually have a noticeable niche of women interested now. I’m also engaged now though so it worked out so far.","I have Good Luck Chuck Syndrome so 95% of my exes married the next person they dated after me. It seems to be that they have to go on at least two dates with me before it works.\nSOURCE:\n\n* First girlfriend cheated on me so I dumped her, she married the next guy.\n\n* Second used me as the Litmus Test to see if she was gay. She is still dating that same girl but I don't know if she's going to marry even though gay marriage is now a thing.\n\n* I dumped the 3rd but we were friends for a while after, she was nervous about the guy who was interested in her after we split. She married him, had a child, and moved the New Mexico.\n\n* fourth went back to her previous BF after I told her that working 60 hours a week at my job meant I couldn't drive 4 hours to see her. Also she didn't understand that factory work meant I couldn't check my phone every twenty minutes for a text. She married him a few years ago.\n\n* Last one was a casual relationship (Chinese Food, watching Archer on Netflix, and lots of sex) and I miss her the most. The sex was great but the lack of expecting anymore than what we were getting from each other was emotionally fulfilling. She got a job across the state and moved in with her most recent BF, so I'm expecting an engagement photo soon.\n\nSo what girl wants to go out on two dates with me, dump me for someone, then get married!? I'll only charge one hundred dollars for the service!","I used to be active on this sub about 5 years ago or so.  I had gotten out of a long term relationship which had lasted through college and was woefully unprepared for the dating world, especially in NYC, so a friend recommended I try OKC.\n\nI was woefully incompetent at it at first, but then I found this sub.  I posted my profile, got lots of critiques, and learned so much about how to make my profile better.  I went on lots of dates with different girls I met on OKC - twelve within about 8 months or so if I'm counting right.  Some went better than others, but one girl really stood out.\n\nWhile drunkenly browsing OKC, I saw the profile of a really cute girl who seemed down to earth and funny.  I wanted to message her, but was way too drunk to think of anything witty to say, so I saved her under my favorites and figured I'd message her later.\n\nI figured out that if I changed my profile, even the tiniest bit like moving around a comma, that OKC's algorithm would bump my profile up and show it to more girls.  So I'd play games on my computer, and every hour or two, answer a question or change a word or two.  While I was doing this one night, I saw that I had gotten a message, and lo and behold, it was the girl that I had favorited a few nights before!\n\nWe went on a date five years ago, and stayed out till 2AM on a Tuesday.  We became exclusive within a month.  We moved in together two years ago.  We got a dog together almost a year ago.  And in may of this year, I asked her to be my wife.\n\nI haven't really been back to r/okcupid for several years, but I stumbled on this sub again from r/all.

I’d been avoiding reactivating due to the bummer it can be plus fear of seeing patients on there (I’m a therapist in an inpatient psych hospital.) Today I logged onto the app and the first profile that popped up was a patient I recently worked with. I panicked a little from not wanting him to see my profile and all the sex questions I answered so I deactivated my account again. AMA. ","We met a little over three years ago. He was super devoted and a really good boyfriend for the first two years. He told me I was the love of his life. I took the California bar and moved to LA with him when he got his dream job.\n\nHe had a months-long affair with his married coworker behind my back. So we're broken up now.\n\n[failure]","I finally got a couple of good pics up a few weeks ago and have seen a very noticeable uptick in matches. From maybe one every two weeks with a rare conversation to one every other day with most leading to a conversation. It's getting a bit much rn honestly as I've been dating one person, have a first date tomorrow, and have three other conversations ongoing. Never been in this position before. Definitely cuffing season. And there's my STS.","In 2011, I contacted a woman online on a dating site outside of the mainstream ones. We live on opposite ends of the state, but we still got to know each other and swapped numbers. We talked on the phone and texted for a few weeks before she abruptly went incognito, but we got back in contact after I looked her up on Facebook in the summer of 2016. It took her a few months to respond, but I was surprised by how receptive she was to my attempt to get back in touch with her, and we hit it off for a few messages before she abruptly stopped responding for another year. I finally got a response from her last Fall, and then she suggested that I come visit her. I told her that I could visit this summer and I really wanted to meet her, but I would have to save up for a few months. Unfortunately, I got a message back from her just a few days ago saying that she appreciates my attentiveness, but she recently started seeing someone else and that we should just remain \"online pals\". It was a shame because even though she is 10 years older than me, I was even more attracted to her in terms of *both* looks and personality than almost all other women I have dated. My hopes of going downstate for a mini-vacation and meeting her were dashed. However, at least the money I save can be used towards buying myself a car and learning how to drive, or even just traveling somewhere else if I want to.","I have had very similar experiences. My \"favorite\" were the ones that manage to come off as both insecure and presumptuous by saying things like \"we'll always be each other's #1\"/\"not looking to leave each other\"/etc. \n\nI even wrote on my profile that I wasn't looking for couples to do threesomes with-- still got those messages. I imagine they were just sending them out to every bi woman on the site. There was a post on r/bisexual a few weeks ago where a woman talked about her experience as an okc couple's unicorn-- it was about as bad as you'd expect. ","I’m flying out to Denver in a few weeks to hang out with a woman I had a huge crush on years ago for a weekend. \n\nWe met at work, went on a date or two, and became friends because she was moving. We’ve kept in contact, and then she threw out  the idea of me flying out for a weekend.  \n\nAs the weekend approaches, the introvert in me is starting to get a little antsy about spending a whole weekend with her. I’m also anxious, because I don’t know what to expect. She’s awesome, and I’m looking forward to spending some time with her as a friend. But there is still that part of me from years ago that still likes her a lot.  \n\nNow that I think about it, going in with zero expectations might be the smartest approach to take...\n\nSorry, now I’m rambling.  \n\nEdit: we are both single at the moment. ","Getting the most out of life, having fun, tearing it up around down. All these seem rather generic, give girls something genuine about YOU that they wont read in other profiles. You're new, say what activies you liked doing in Chicago that you'd like to try in Denver, maybe something you haven't done yet. \n\nLet women know what you bring to the table, a girl doesn't just want to see about tearing it out in the town but maybe something more specific like, (in from houston so I'll use houston examples) \"I've been meaning to go to the houston zoo lights before it ends, drive in movie theater, the outdoor theater, and so on\". A girl will most likely want to say, hey! I have been wanting to hit up zoo lights too! Rather than say, I wanna tear it around town too. Makes sense? \n\n\nBe specific, a rule I learned as well is to never ask a girl to go out but give her a specific thing to do. Your chances of getting a positive response will go up if you invite to the zoo over just saying let's go out next week. \n\nBest of luck!","phrases like \"just trying to get by\" and \"some people might call me naive\" and \"not the easiest to earn\" come across as negative. it's not that they're terrible phrases or anything but the tone you set changes how other stuff reads. i would find a better way to phrase these or just remove them altogether\n\nin general you come across as very stiff. if that's who you are, that's fine, but if you think you're a fun or funny person, try to punch it up a little.\n\n&amp;gt;I have a wide range of hobbies that go from being a gamer, to Dungeons and Dragons, to singing, and even to writing and reading.\n\nso this is super nitpicky but dungeons and dragons is a game. so it doesn't really make sense to say \"hobbies range from gaming to dungeons and dragons\"\n\nalso nitpicky but I feel like the phrasing is just awkward? usually with this structure you would say something like \"ranges from X to Y\" and stop your list there.\n\nfor both of these reasons, and because the hobbies are not that diverse anyway, you could just change it to \"my hobbies include x, y, z, w, and r\" instead. or something more punched up if you want but you get the idea.\n\n&amp;gt;I'm here looking for someone who can take life day by day while keeping a clear head and an honest outlook on life. That isn't to say a positive or negative one, just someone honest, earnest, and not afraid to do the right thing.\n\nimo this comes across as if you feel that you have these qualities and that other people generally don't. the words themselves are not negative but it has a sort of air to it that feels judgmental. basically i read this and i think \"this person is going to expect me to think just like him, and be upset and mean about it if i don't.\"\n\n&amp;gt;I guess some people might call me naive, but I just like to think I have some integrity to me. I always try to do what's right by me and by others, and I can assure you that my loyalty, while not the easiest to earn, is unfaltering.\n\nbasically the same thing as above. i don't think either of these sections really help you at all.\n\nin general traits like loyalty, honesty, and integrity are not really things you want to emphasize. it's not that they're bad things, obviously, but they're things that we just assume you have (or, think you have). it also is just generally not great to list positive traits you have, since there's no reason we should believe you. ie if you're funny, say things that make me laugh, don't just say you're funny. \n\n&amp;gt;I love to travel and to experience new things. If you bring something new to the table, you can bet I'll probably give it a shot at least once (unless it's illegal, I try to avoid that kind of stuff).\n\njust drop the illegal part, otherwise fine\n\n&amp;gt;Anyways, there's a lot to me that I can't put into words off the top of my head, so go ahead and send me a message. I can't see likes, and I'd love to get to know you! I hope you have a great day.\n\ndrop the \"i can't see likes\" part","If you see successful profiles of men your age you'd see the following:\n\n* They work out. Your post history indicates you refuse to get in better shape. \n\n* They have good pictures. Quite honestly, your pictures on your profile are pretty boring. Your main picture is in front of a parking lot, the second picture is a selfie with a kind of creepy looking smile (this has nothing to do with your teeth, it just looks kinda forced), I spent more time looking at the plant in your third picture than you, the fourth picture is fine honestly, although the lighting is really dark and the setting's a bit odd. The fifth picture.. you're the least attractive guy in the picture, your belly is showing pretty prominently, and you're the only one not directly looking into the camera, while the other two guys are.  I say none of this to be mean, just being honest about what I took away.  Honestly, I too have a pretty creepy looking smile, when I force a smile it looks awful. So I either use candid pictures where I was smiling, or smile with my mouth closed (like you do in your first picture). For reference, here are mine: https://imgur.com/a/i7iQi The bike and t-rex pictures usually make girls laugh and are good conversation starters, and the Mario one is another silly one. I honestly think your first picture would be a solid profile picture if it had a more interesting background that caught people's attention, you look good in the picture.  So a couple silly pictures wouldn't hurt your cause and would show you're a fun guy. If you're not willing to work out and get in shape, you're gonna have to spice up your profile a bit. The first thing people see are your appearance and your photos, so those need to be fixed before anything. Great photos + a meh profile will always be more successful than a great profile with meh photos.\n\n* A profile that's both descriptive and playful. Your profile does read almost like a resume, rather than with personality.  It's very matter of fact and doesn't really say much about you other than that you work in finance and like reading. It could use one or two playful quips throughout it to inject a little humor. Your first paragraph reads really well to be quite honest, though I think the second sentence is kind of blah. You're looking for an intelligent, ambitious woman who feels her work is important to the greater good. So is EVERYONE ELSE. I personally think sentences that say \"I'm looking for a woman that's X\" just don't serve much purpose unless they're based around a specific lifestyle (i.e. fitness-centric). I would leave out the \"My friends tell me I'm a very good listener and I'd like to hear what you've read lately\". Instead, put together a list of descriptors about yourself.  An example on my profile: \"I'm a full-blown utlitarian, a feminist, an affectionate extrovert, a loyal friend, and a comma whore.\" There's a little playful quip at the end, but I basically described a lot of my personality with that list. Try to put together a list of things you know are true about yourself. If you're not going to list a lot of your hobbies (I usually don't on my profile), at least give a very strong picture of who you are as a person. Also, definitely include that you took up salsa dancing. That's a pretty adventurous hobby and will take a lot of women by surprise. Girls consistently write about adventure on their profiles and want someone who's exciting. You can phrase it like \"I'm adventurous and enjoy trying new things. In fact, I recently took up salsa dancing.\" \n\nHopefully this helps.  I didn't want to post my entire profile, because I don't think copying what I do on my profile would be very authentic. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.\n","&amp;gt; I'm currently unemployed but I'm learning for a qualification atm necessary for the job I'm aiming for. How do I put that into the profile, without appearing as a lazy waster?\n\n\"Entrepreneur\" or \"Ceo\" of a company you made up.  People will know what you mean.\n\n&amp;gt; One of my biggest hobbies is playing guitar, should I take a selfie of me doing it? I fear it might make me look as someone who doesn't go out, and it would be in a basement where all my instruments are. Or should I do it outside (Like during a hike?)\n\nDo you have friends?  Do you jam with friends?  Try to get a candid/natural pic of you playing in your natural environment.  Don't go doing a one-armed handstand while holding your guitar in the other in front of some grand vista in some huge effort to make yourself look interesting.  Taking a picture on a timer of yourself is fine but (ime) it's hard to make look good and natural (can't hurt to try).  It's way better to get a third party to take a few natural looking pictures of you.\n\n&amp;gt; Also, how do you take a full body pic of yourself with your phone when it doesn't have a timer?\n\nIt does have a timer.  I've installed *Open Camera* which does a photo every 3 seconds plus a 10 second timer because I'm a loner and it works for me.  I.e. install an app that has the features you need, but your built-in camera def. has a timer.\n\n&amp;gt; One last thing: I suffer from social anxiety and am very uncomfortable with posting pics of me in the fear that someone recognizes me.\n\nHi Hello.\n\n1) Imagine the very worst case scenario, and then remind yourself that even if that happens you'll be ok\n\n2) You can get help to work on that particular problem, but you can also learn about it and work on it yourself\n\n3) Nobody is actually going to recognize you -- you'll figure that out if/when you spend enough time to swipe through half the population in your area\n\n&amp;gt; I thought I could leave it blank and text women and eventually send them directly to them. How acceptable is that? I rather want to take an active approach, will I be discarded for that?\n\nNo.  99.9% of everything is your pictures.  I'm not saying don't write a bio, but I am saying put at least 4 diverse and good (outlier-level good) photos up.\n\n&amp;gt; As I said, I have no idea how dating works on-or offline.\n\nWelcome to the club :) :)","Photos are the most important part.\n\nCome on man, google \"male profile photo.\" Look at the most attractive ones: the lighting, the expressions, angle of the face, everything. Now look at your pictures. Now delete all of your photos and replace them with better ones.\n\nAlso unless touching that statue is some strange local custom, stop it. That's weird. You could at least try to do it less awkwardly.\n\nAfter you've fixed your photos:\n\nThe profile isn't bad, but it needs some tweaks. Biggest thing is this:\n\n&amp;gt; China here I come!\n\nAre you moving to China? Are you doing it soon? This throws all possible dating into question, making an already questionable profile just not worth it. You might also not come out and explicitly state the Sinophile thing, the calligraphy and language is enough to get it across.\n\nI'm all for casting a broad net, but your age range might come across as a little desperate.\n\nI have no idea what you do with your time besides go to movies. Add more content. Be more specific than \"going out with friends.\" Borderline anecdotal statements make for a refreshingly interesting profile read and give a better sense of your personality.","The last one's got some nice personality though we can't really see your face, and the one in the trees is okay although the light sucks. The one with the Korean girls isn't great, but the background makes up for your horrible fashion and having girls in a dating picture. The hill pics and the dead eyes indoor selfie absolutely have to go. Dress up in your nicest clothing short of a full suit, do something with your hair, and go out into a city with a friend and have them take a pic at a few spots around town until you get one you like. You need a nice main profile pic.\n\nDo you have any alternate photos that we could help you pick replacements from?\n\nFor the profile, I would tone down the children's shows a little bit. I had to look up the Steven's Universe reference. Don't you have anything better to be thinking about?\n\n\"You're the kind of person who... close-minded assholes... against them\" - 100% needs to go if you listen to nothing else I say. Even if someone agrees with you in principle they're not going to date someone who is so open about their anger and bitterness. \n\nI would also try to add some content beyond typical nerd stuff. It's attractive to be (or at least appear) well-rounded.","It's mostly your pictures. The first one is too dark and moody, especially since you're not smiling. Everyone else has already been over the shirtless pic. Third one is okay, but nothing special. It's the only one I would keep. Try to get some more normal photos with decent lighting and the nicer end of your everyday clothing. \n\nThe profile is pretty good, not any major issues. Your English bothers me, but I don't think a lot of people care about that as much as I do. A couple things:\n\n&amp;gt;If anything i've said\n\nI've, capital I\n\n&amp;gt;just send a message, whether it's to ask where I got my amazing space cat pants or to tell me the dangers of having a cat, much less 3.\n\nToo many commas. When your structure goes \"Clause, clause, clause.\" the first and last ones should make sense with the middle one excluded. Split this into two sentences. \n\nYour mentions of monsters is a little weird.\n\nThe way you lead into your self-summary with \"I'm a quick learner but also a quick forgetter\" is rather jarring. Also forgetter isn't a word? or it's an extremely awkward one at least. Your self-summary should be a quick overview of the best highlights of your profile. Assume someone isn't going to read anything else, what do you want them to know about you? Try to fill out the rest of your profile then come back and write your summary with this in mind. You already do some of this, but you can make it better.\n\n&amp;gt;I put my best foot forward in everything I do and I promise that same effort to you along with a great time.\n\nGet rid of this sentence too. This is not the place to be promising things to strangers. Everyone like to say they try their best, we're not going to believe you just because you typed it out. If this is really an important thing for you to convey then show it, don't say it.","First of all, You're supposed to put your real name on your profile now.\n\nFor the pictures I don't care for the chess photo, my order would be: dark bar, flute, smiling outdoors in t-shirt, cat, then chess. Drop the sunglasses photo. A nice big toothy smile showing you can have fun is a good one to throw in there. You also mention going new places meeting new people a lot, how about adding some interesting photos from all of that? Your profiles says really interesting dude with cool stories, but your pictures (which is what people judge you on first) say boring, possibly loner dude who may or may not have ever left his home town. \n\nI rather like your profile, doesn't need nearly as much work as your photos. Some suggestions:\n\nAddress the issue of what you're looking for. You mention how you're constantly gone for up to year at a time, but don't give context for if that's going to continue and what you hope to get out of dating if that's the case. I've passed up intriguing profiles for this very reason.\n\nSplit your self-summary into at least two paragraphs. A good spot would be to start a new one at \"I love...\" to make it a lot more readable. \n\nDostoevsky isn't going to win you a lot of friends, maybe try a more interesting author to put first? Total nitpick. \n\nThe tree thing is a little weird, you would probably be better off replacing that with something else.\n\n\"Typical Friday night\" and \"message me if\" sections are definitely your weakest, I would replace or remove both. For Friday night it says nothing about you. This is a good spot to tell another interesting story about yourself, or throw out some fun date ideas so they start anticipating possibly spending a Friday night with you before even deciding to message. Message me if is where you seal the deal. Not a great spot to be throwing out obscure musical references and stating the obvious. Give them a couple conversation starters, or remind them of the strongest parts of your profile.","First of all how old are you? It would be helpful to see the \"About me\" section so we can get an idea of who you are and what you're looking for.\n\nOverall it's pretty good, but could use some improvement.\n\n**Most important part, the pictures:**\n\nFirst pic is quite bad. I don't recognize the filter that's been applied, looks like a weird mix of very poor foreground highlighting (and gaussian blurring of the rest) and compression or cell shading, but whatever it is is terrible. The photo is ugly and we can't see your face.\n\nAlso try to keep all of your pics from the last year, maybe two years if you really don't have enough. A picture from 2015 when 2019 is coming up fast is unacceptable. \n\nFewer pictures with hats. We should know whether you have hair or not before the 8th picture.\n\nNot a fan of pics of people holding other people's kids. Feels a little, idk, creepy or desperate? Like \"women like kids, right?\" sort of thing. Also not a great pic of you anyway.\n\nYour second picture is probably the best, I would make that your main until you can find a better one\n\n**The profile:**\n\n&amp;gt;  interested in life \n\nSuper generic and boring. Your opener especially needs to be a bit more punchy Now that people can only see the first sentence or so when swiping. It takes work, but it's helpful to get straight at the heart of who you are here to draw people in.\n\n&amp;gt; I'm currently making some sacrifices to build a business, while still making a point of enjoying life. \n\nYou would sound much more date-able if you left it at \"Working hard to build my own business.\"\n\n&amp;gt; Kent for a bit, now that I've got some time, looking \n\nKent for a bit, but now that I've got some time I'm looking\n\nTry to proofread more. \"Kid\" also shouldn't be capitalized. \n\nPersonally I think the  exclamation marks joke is a little tired. I would change the eight-year old sentence to: \" Acting like an eight year old that has just realized there's no one to tell him off\" (feel less forced without the exclamation too) \n\n&amp;gt; Glastonbury Festival I keep returning to for   \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt; and decent modern stuff sci-fi too \n\nAre you not a native English speaker? I might put that at the top of the profile so people aren't put off by it.\n\n&amp;gt; Last  one I mixed up Sashsa and Digweed with Foo Fighters as an idea of  eclectic tastes. \n\nWhat does this mean? Last one of what? At the last festival? Are you a DJ? I don't mind your sentence fragments as they give a better sense of your personality and how you talk, but make sure you actually have proper context for them.","* Have good photos up that are well lit and preferably not with harsh light\n* Pics that show your face without anything obstructing it\n* At least one good full body pic\n* A few pics that have you doing an activity\n* Fill out your profile and let it show your personality\n* Make sure your profile isn't too short or long\n* Have a hook or something that people can use in your profile to start up a conversation\n\nMay also be a good idea to post your profile for a critique. Not everyone has an active profile so posting screenshots of your profile will be most effective. The .sidebar has some tips that can help you as well.","Photos aren't good or bad. You should at least add a full body shot, a clear shot of your face from within 45 degrees of straight on, and one of you doing something with friends.\n\nPlease don't define yourself as a \"software person.\"\n\nFill out the profile more. What do you do besides work (we don't care about your work, stop talking about it beyond showing your passion for it in a sentence or two) and go to concerts? If you really don't have anything interesting at least add some fun anecdotes.\n\nThe fact that you marked finding smoking disgusting as unacceptable is weird since you said you never smoke.","First rule of OKCupid - you don't talk about OKCupid. (or any other online dating platforms for that matter).\n\nUsed the word calisthenics on profile - sploosh. \n\nI would leave out the BA and MA, weird thing to prioritize starting with and comes off a little braggy. \n\nDelete everything from \"There's much...\" to \"writing these things.\" This profile is to give a sense of who you are and what it would be like to date you. Try not to break the 4th wall, it's awkward and honestly we don't care.\n\n\"but I don't often go\" \"but I doubt I always will be\" these sound very passive. Try to write with a little more confidence, it's a lot more attractive. \n\n\"May sound pretty typical\" yeah it does, why not tell us in more detail so it's actually interesting? For example I plan to move to France in a couple years, adopt a kid at some point and come back to the US to completely switch careers and become a school teacher. It doesn't have to be accurate; everyone knows things don't often work out that way, what's important is that you actually have a plan and you can articulate it passionately. \n\n\"maybe one day! A man can dream.\" Again, super passive.\n\nUsing the colon before The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a lot more awkward than just integrating it into the sentence (i.e. \"back to a lot it would be The Good, ...\")\n\n\"Unfortunately, I'm not too hopeful...\" - impressive, you've made this sentence meta, passive, *and* pessimistic. The rest of your \"looking for\" section isn't very helpful, that's stuff you can easily filter yourself and just makes it sound like you've got an unattractively low bar. \n\nAll in all, decent but could use a lot of tweaks. It should be less passive, more specific, and more optimistic. I've noticed that you don't really mention any hobbies. Most people overdo it on that front, but it does help to talk about at least a couple so that people can connect with you or give them talking points. ","This took way too long to write but I hope you really read this.\n\nI used to be absolutely terrible at interacting with people in general, and even less so with girls and dating. I was in the same boat as you. It took a great deal of concentrated effort and repeated failures over the last 10 years before I became somewhat \"okay\" and much later \"good\" at socializing and dating. Most of the advice is actually pretty solid, but I think you may need help interpreting it.\n\n* Be confident\n\nThere's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem here. You might draw on past success to believe in yourself and act like you're the boss, but if you've never succeeded, how can you be the boss? You fake it. Fake it until you succeed, and then you'll have real experience and successes to draw upon. \n\n* Be yourself\n\nMy personality is quite strong and eccentric. I'm also a huge fucking nerd. This is often too much for first interactions. Cutting down the \"flair\" to 50% and ramping up to 100% over time has worked out much better for me. Not many people like raw durian the first time they try it. Durian ice cream is much more palatable. But the point is, don't pretend to be someone you're not. You should still be you, but you know, maybe you shouldn't talk about your weird hobbies of fetishes on the first date.\n\n* No expectations\n\nI don't think you should have no expectation but you should keep the expectations realistic.\n\nHappiness = Reality - Expectation\n\nThe more you expect, the less happy you'll be.\n\nFor example if you approach a super hot girl, you should expect that you're going to fail 99% of the time (unless you're Ryan Gosling). When you inevitably fail, you shouldn't beat yourself. It was expected. It's okay. But if you really believed you had a good shot, the failure is going to sting.\n\nYou should reflect on your failures. See what you did and how to improve. Then you get back on your feet and try again. It's very easy to be discouraged. I struggle with this all the time.\n\n* Misogynistic bullshit\n\nI interpret this as, \"don't be that stereotypical nice guy.\" Don't be an asshole either. Avoid being overly appeasing and accommodating. It can seem like you have no backbone or that you're too desperate or thirsty. These aren't exactly attractive characteristics. Yeah, don't be misogynistic. \n\n* Try seeing women as people\n\nThis kind of goes along with the previous point. The more I like a girl, the more I'm likely to put her on a pedestal. It's difficult. When you prostrate yourself and worship the very ground she walks on, you run the risk being stepped on. Most people don't want to date beneath them so don't put yourself down there by being overly appeasing and accommodating. Have some backbone.\n\n* \"Just say hi\"/just talk to them/just put yourself out there\n\n&amp;gt;One time I was at a bar and I walked over to a woman and said hi.\n\nI've approached hundreds of women I can tell you the opening isn't important. You can say almost anything with little effect on the outcome (pickup lines might have a very small up or down tick here). What's important is how you carry the conversation/interaction afterwards. That means you can't say \"hi,\" stare for a bit, and shyly run away. The other point here is that saying \"hi\" is 100x better than just sitting in the corner and staring at them.\n\n* Just go out and have a good time and it'll happen\n\nYes, being introverted means you might avoid social activities or events. You miss 100% of the shots you didn't make because you weren't even on the court. You don't have to go out to bars and nightclubs to meet people. You should find activities or hobbies that you enjoy and find ways to meet people through that. For example you can meet people at the climbing gym, tennis club, hiking adventures, book club, anime/gaming events, etc. \n\nBut you shouldn't do these things just to find a girlfriend. Do them because you actually like the activity or club. Meeting a potential date is an added bonus.\n\n* You can actually do it, but you just don't know that you know\n\nYes, you can, but you'll need a shitton of practice first. And that means failing repeatedly. There's no easy way around this.\n\n* Have a life\n\nSame as above-- how can these passions/hobbies put you in situations where you meet people?\n\n* Stop wanting it\n\nI think most people can sense desperation/thirst. It's a turn off. Try acting like you're not thirsty even if you're as parched as a mother fucker.\n\n&amp;gt;I fucking hate when I ask people how they get laid/get dates and their immediate reply is laughing, followed by asking me if I'm serious, followed by more laughing about how absurd my question is because it must be obvious to everyone in the world but me. It happens so often I try not to ask.\n\nIf this is usually what happens, you're probably doing something wrong. Try to look back and figure it out. Was it a relevant question with respect to the previous conversation? Is this a wildly inappropriate setting? Do you know this person well enough to have a candid conversation about having sex? \n\n","So, I actually read this (hooray boredom along with a weird surge of depression.) There are three things you need to learn:\n\n* Stop agonizing over every little thing when it comes to online dating. If you continue to do this, you’re going to find yourself mentally burnt out. Honestly, treat it with minimal expectations, so that if you do match and meet with someone cool, it can be a pleasant surprise.\n\n* When you ask someone out, don’t say “if you’re free, want to do something?” Come up with something specific. Show that initiative.\n\n* Finally, she said **she was only looking for friends**. You do not take that as an opening to say “ok, that’s cool, but I still want to pursue a relationship with you. However, if you want to be friends, we can do that.” Do not, under any circumstances, accept a date with the mission of changing someone’s mind about what they’re looking for or what they like. If she says she is only looking for friends, don’t go in with an ulterior motive.\n\nThe fact that you wrote such a long post about what many of us experience on a rather frequent basis shows that you need to go into this with a different headspace. Ghosting, account deletions, fading: these are all very common.","\n\nWrite in your profile what you've written in here, that you take things slow at the beginning and want to establish firm camaraderie before things escalate physically. Given how opposed you are to sex in the early stages, I think it's pretty important you explain that. Also, answer a limited number of sexual questions, making sure to include the \"how long before sex\" with the 6+ dates answer. If you answer 5-6 sex questions with one indicating you take your time, and the rest explaining you like sex, that's about the best you can do. There are PLENTY of girls that choose 6+ dates as their preference, and I'd advise you focus on those girls. \n\nIn addition to what everyone has said, if you want to wait to have sex, I would probably take it slow on going back to each other's places. Plan dates that are fun and activity-based around town and spend nights out for  the first few dates. Although I'm also a guy, I'm a person that wants that sexual connection very early, and I can tell you that using that approach could weed people out who are sexually driven and looking for that before anything else. \n\nThe only thing I caution you about is that just because someone is quicker to want to jump into bed than you doesn't mean they don't want the same things you want. I find most people in relationships want someone to be close with and spend time with. I want someone to be close with and share nights at home with, as well as go out with. \n\nThe most important questions to answer are: How long do you want to wait to have sex in your ideal world? Do you always prefer most activities over sex? The way you wrote this post, it seems like sex just isn't a priority for you in general.","This is going to sound super weird, but it might help fellow women in the sub. \n\nI went through this ridiculous period middle of last year where I had to do battle with the startup I was in and juggling job offers and financially had to untangle a Meereenese Knot. The mantra and attitude that helped me through the stress was, \"What would a dude do?\" The guys that I have worked with the last decade wouldn't have stressed as much as I did about \"paying the dues\", they would have said, \"Fuck it - you want your money? Come get it.\" They would have said, \"I'll work for you if you give me a starting bonus and only if.\" They would say, \"How can I make this situation in my favor?\" Imposter syndrome is so debilitating (for women and men), but anyone who asks why I have been successful in my career, it is because I am (mostly)fine with looking, leaping, and figuring everything else out when I land. \n\nEveryone should be just a little more badass than they feel this year. ","&amp;gt;I tend to notice that after 3 or so dates, momentum dies with a majority of women I dated. Does anyone else have this happen?\n\nEffectively every woman I've dated since I went back on the market. \n\n&amp;gt;How do I keep the spark going?\n\nYou don't. What it means is you just aren't that into that person. End it and start looking again. I've tried at least five times now to convince myself I like someone more than I do, and it just ends up wasting everyone's time and leaves me feeling more guilty for it. \n\n&amp;gt;To be more specific, I try to keep myself from being clingy and needy and only text to make plans usually.\n\nJust text when you feel like it and not any other time. Everyone has a different cadence. It sounds as if you think *doing* things will influence how much you *like* a person, but those are (mostly) mutually exclusive things, unfortunately. When you really like someone, you'll know. Take this from someone who was once head-over-heels for someone and knows the difference. ","Celebrating my mom's birthday tonight and dining out! \n\nAlso having no idea if the guy I'm messaging (and only one in interested in atm) is interested because while he's very responsive and conversational, he also said he might get off okc because he's still recovering from his recent break up (which I know is true cuz he's a friend of an acquaintance of mine irl). ¿But he's also still responding well?","100 question minimum. Filter out major preferences not a match for you. In my case non-monagamy/people in a relationship already.  I still get them in my searches and quick match , even though I set a filter for monogamy.

Without the non mon folks, I guess there would be only 5 single guys in my age range instead of 15, so I guess OKC will keep serving them up....\n\nAssuming people who swipe in Quick Match actually get messages, I am feeling more ok about the new messaging system.

It has been among the most active, and has the best quality of profiles out of all of them. In ~10 years, I have used a variety of dating sites/apps including POF, Zoosk, Match, Tallfriends, Datehookup, and Bumble. Here are the annoyances I ran into with each one:\n\nBumble: I received **zero** matches despite using it for at least a month and swiping right on hundreds of profiles. Also the app showed me profiles of women who were outside of my distance range.\n\nTallfriends: There were mostly women who hadn't logged on in months/years, and few new users. Though in fairness, it is a niche dating site. Despite being a guy of only average height, I managed to get two numbers on there.\n\nZoosk: Most of the profiles looked fake. They lacked self-summaries and other forms of basic info. \n\nDatehookup: I constantly received messages/winks from bots. \n\nMatch: I received no replies after a month of being subscribed and messaging dozens of women, yet after my subscription ended, I started suspiciously getting messages.\n\nPOF: Many of the profiles and the photos that I've seen there are either trashy or just simply bad. Also when you use the \"search\" function, the same profiles may appear repeatedly, and there is no option to hide profiles. Still, POF has been the most reliable site I have used outside of OKC, and I got a few dates from it.\n\nIf I were you, I would still use OKC, but stop paying. You've paid for premium membership, but still see a lack of results. Even if you don't pay, you can still message whoever you want, and you can find out who you receive likes/messages from by using DoubleTake.

Personally speaking, I'd definitely appreciate it.\n\nOn the other hand, dating apps are typically \"swipe and forget\". Getting a reply or match of any sort might make people unnecessarily get their hopes up. Apparently dudes are thirsty, so you could provoke a pleading act, which might quickly get awkward on your end.\n\nThough if it's because you're out of town, I suppose it wouldn't be too bad to just send a response, \"hey thanks for the superlike I think you're really cute too but I'm out of town anyway\", immediately unmatch, and hope it made his day. \n\nIf I were him I'd chalk it up on the internal tally of potential dream girls who I'll never have a chance with simply because of the happenstance of life.","If I can't hold ongoing conversation on a daily basis with my SO (this includes texting and in person), it won't work out. I wouldn't even agree to date someone unless that ongoing conversation is firmly in place already. I'm pretty extroverted and talkative, so I do like knowing what's going on in my SO's life. I prefer to text throughout the day every day when possible (Not from the jump, just with someone I'm really serious with), so even when we're apart, I want there to be ongoing conversation. I will admit finding someone else that desires that level of communication is hard to find. I need someone that thinks that's natural and normal within a relationship. Obviously there will be spans of time where one of you is busy at work or out with friends, whatever. But when my partner or I am not busy, I do expect that we'll be holding good conversation. \n\nAs far as in person communication goes, there is obviously time where silence needs to happen and I do think you need to be able to be comfortable with silence around each other. I honestly find that I put in a lot of the communication while I'm apart from someone and the focus becomes more activity-based or physically-based when we're around each other. There's still conversation together, but when you're holding daily conversation there will be times you don't have a ton more to say, and that's okay.\n\nI dated someone who was really bad with texting and I don't think I could do it again.

I just need the gross income from last year's taxes and I couldn't find any record of that so had to request it from the IRS, but to verify my identity they sent me a piece of mail that I have to wait for before I can finish.\n\nI've been working on doing a front lever.  While I'm not very close, I've made some good progress on working up to it and I can do a sort of inverted row with my legs tucked in which is kind of cool.\n\nI'm also almost to an all-time-low in my weight and my current diet has been really easy so I think I'll be able to maintain it for quite a while.  Last time I got under 140 I immediately wanted to take a break from eating at a deficit.\n\nI made a couple of awesome meals.  A jambalaya during the middle of the week, and today I made a vegan sweet potato/chickpea curry.","Body dysmorphia. A couple times a year I get obsessed with trying to get back down to my ROTC weight even though I was dizzy all the time because after a certain height, BMI rubrics are a fucking lie.\n\nHair. I transitioned into baldy status but I still don't like the shine nor the shape of my head.\n\nVoice. I hate hearing myself talk because deep and full all the time. Also, several people flat out told me they were surprised to hear me talk because and they weren't expecting my voice to sound the way it does.\n\nSeeing myself on video/candid pics.

I am trying to teach myself more IT stuff but am finding it very difficult. Reading books becomes boring and sometimes confuses me more. Watching videos doesn't seem to help much either. It leaves me feeling disinterested in the field overall and wondering if it's even right for me. \n\nBut I have no idea what the hell else I could do for myself career wise since I am too introverted to do anything liberal arts related (as I learned the hard way many years ago after getting a Bachelors in Communications Studies). If only you could make a decent living shitposting about how much your life sucks, I'd be set for life\n\n\nAlso I think that little bit of skin right below my tongue is swollen. At this point it looks like a second, smaller tongue and it feel like I have a lump right below my tongue; which is kind of annoying.","I might be, but in my opinion, that's kind of a peril in any new relationship. We have different goals regarding marriage, mental health issues that may not be the best fit, and **I found a bottle of fake maple syrup in his kitchen cabinet**. It's a *very* new relationship and I like him though so. Much too soon to determine actual long term compatibility, but not too soon to keep on eye on things that'd require compromise and communication down the line. \n\nI've done it knowingly before for 2 years (in which we both knew without really saying and never said \"I love you\") and for 6 months (He was poly, I'm mono, and I was moving 200 miles away).

Agree with too much sunglasses, I usually avoid having them in any of my pics. The way you worded the ice cream thing is pretty awkward. I don't care for the whole boba thing, especially since 2/3 of your profile is now about how much you love desserts. Also half of your pics are in East Asia and you talk about how much you love an Asian food, did you spend a semester there or something? I would try to get some more local pics, or at least a bit more variety in terms of what you're doing, the background, etc. That's definitely a nitpick though.","I think it depends on what you think being \"body positive\" is. Speaking personally, losing weight is much easier when you don't see your own body as a sign of your moral failings. \"I am fat because I am a disgusting lazy person\" or \"being fat signifies something about me that makes me unloveable\" or \"if I was a better person I wouldn't be fat\" are thoughts that are a. common among the overweight (IME) and make it really hard to commit yourself to a healthier lifestyle. \"I am a good person who deserves to be happy, I just happen to also be fat, and that is because I am consuming more calories that I need to maintain a lower bodyweight\" is the headspace you need to be in and it does require a certain amount of positivity about your body.\n\nIdk. Promoting obesity as healthy and normal is bad, but so is the idea that internalized shame and self hatred are useful.","Male / 24 / UK\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fCsn8\n\nI am currently using 1,2,3.\n\nNot sure whether to replace with 1,2,4 as the 1,3 are both very smiley.\n\nAlternatively 1,2,5 or 1,2,5,4\n\nNot sure if 5 is good or at bit too cliche and posed.\n\nFor reference, my normal dating bio reads:\n\n\"Usually looking for things to photograph, eating too much Asian and American food, or pretending that I own a dog.\"","I'm 27 and just got out of a brief dating round (2 months) with a single mom. I can answer your questions. \n\n&amp;gt;1) She is 36 with a 9 y/o. She is living with her parents (which I initially thought was a red flag) but is there to save for a house and says she has no debt. She says that she has a good job (Accounting) and has a degree.\n\nHonestly, having the support network of her parents is probably going to be a benefit, not a downside, for you. It means it's easy to run off for a night to a wine bar if they're around to look after the 9 y/o. Trust me, getting a sitter or whatever is a huge pain. The only downside I can think of is it's going to be hard to get quality time *with* her when you're there. There's the child and the parents who will likely be a presence which prevents some of the privacy benefits an individual living alone offers.  Weigh the pros and cons of that against how much you think this person likes going out vs. staying in. \n\n&amp;gt;2) The other one is 38 and divorced with two daughters (17 and 18 y/o).\n\nThat means they're pretty much on their own and living their life. It makes dating pretty easy, in my opinion. \n\n&amp;gt;I have always had a personal \"rule\" not to get involved with women with kids\n\nWhy? \n\n&amp;gt;but it's becoming more and more common to the point that I am really limiting my dating pool to keep doing this.\n\nAt 39 the number of women you meet who *don't* have kids will increasingly shrink until (probably) about 50, when it will stay constant. But you're probably ruling out &amp;gt;50% of eligible women just because of this rule. Maybe it's important to you, that's totally fine. But just be aware of that cost. \n\n&amp;gt;What advice do you have about the different aspects or challenges of dating a single mom?\n\nThe mom I dated was only *just* back on the market and raising a toddler. He was an absolute angel and she was (and is) a fantastic mother. That made things significantly easier insofar as she knew what she was doing and had a handle on the day-to-day. YMMV with older kids, but one drawback was this woman I dated was she had very few hobbies to entertain outside of her kid—that's *good* for being a parent, but not so good for someone who wants to go out and do exciting things (me). The children will always come first, that means no spontaneous trips to the wine bar or Paris for the weekend. You have to consider the fathers in this situation too. They'll (almost certainly) be around to some capacity because of the children. Maybe that's not a big deal, but some exes can be possessive, manipulative, and wreak absolute hell not only for you by being around, but also by pitting the child against the mother. I've seen some really ugly shit between divorced/separated parents. \n\n&amp;gt;Should I give it a shot if all else goes well?\n\nIt really depends on the reasons for not dating moms, but I had a fantastic time dating this woman. Things fell apart because there just wasn't enough chemistry (and a few incompatibilities to boot), but ultimately I don't think the fact that she was a mom was the reason things failed. I say it's worth considering. ","I'm almost done with *Can it happen here* a collection of essays about how/if authoritarianism could develop in America.  It has a really great diversity of opinion, even if some of the essays have an obnoxiously strong ideological slant.  I almost put it down after reading the first few essays.\n\nI just finished *The Courage to Be Disliked: The Japanese Phenomenon That Shows You How to Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness* which was ok.  It was a dialogue, which made it feel like I'm gonna have to hit it with a re-read in order to really understand it.  Otherwise the philosophy it puts forward isn't totally new so much as newly attributed to Alfred Adler.\n\nI need to finish the audiobook for *Sex at Dawn* which is interesting but a little dishonest -- halfway through I realized I was going to need to read a critique of its position so at some point I'll get around to reading *Sex at Dusk: Lifting the Shiny Wrapping from Sex at Dawn*.  *Sex at Dawn* basically puts forward the idea that for humans pair-bonding is crap and we're '''supposed''' to be having many polyandrous flings with a broad and co-existing social group.  It's a little over the top, maybe the truth is in the middle - sometimes we ought to be banging it out with a bunch of people, and sometimes we like to settle into periods of pair-bonded monogamy?\n\nI also have *Overcharged: Why Americans Pay Too Much For Health Care* in my backlog but it looks long, dense, and hard.\n\nI recently finished *Where the Red Fern Grows* for fun, and it was good.  A little religious, reading level was a little low, but it was a nice relaxing story to read on the metro.\n\nUh dealbreakers?  Talking about how good 50 shades or twilight or whatever was is gonna get a major eye roll from me.","OK, so your profile is reasonably well written and inoffensive. Obviously being pansexual, a-gender (a word apparently so unusual that my laptop will not accept it without a '-') and non monogamous is going to narrow down your dating pool. I have never heard of where you live so I assume it's not a huge town. I would suggest setting your distance settings as wide as possible.\n\nYour photos also aren't great. See the sidebar for how to improve.\n\nFinally, having an age range of 18-40 for a person of 35 is going to be red flag for a lot of people. Consider increasing your min age to at least 21 to avoid looking predatory (or perhaps 22 if you prefer that your dates can pay for themselves) and possibly expanding upwards in age range by an equal number of years.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck","That would be an instant deal breaker for me unless he either:\n\nA. Lives in in-law quarters or other kind of apartment attached to his parent's property\n\nB. Lives with his parents because they are in poor health and he needs to care for them. \n\nI would assume that a guy who lives with his parents because he misses them and wants to save money, which you described as your reasons, does not value his independence. At 30, I expect a man to be capable of handling adult responsibilities on his own. I also expect him to be enthusiastic about building his own life as an independent man.","Not single moms, but my (32F) partner is a divorced dad (45M) with 60% custody of a 9 year old boy (with ADHD and high on the spectrum, incidentally). The simple answer is that obviously it can and does work, but that that generalization means jack shit when it comes to you and your potential partner as individuals. \n\nEvery single relationship comes with built-in sacrifices and compromises that must be made. You get to decide which ones are acceptable to you. I'd say treat them like anyone else, decide if you're steady enough to navigate those compromises with other humans in play, and see how it goes.\n\nBut the biggest rule is: don't fuck up the kid. If you get to the point where you've met and interacted with the them (I didn't meet him until the year mark), there is a HUGE weight of responsibility—basically, it's campsite rules.

I had something like only 2 matches over 90% in the entire state. I looked into it for a couple of days, was totally appalled and depressed by the whole thing and gave up.\n\nThen I moved to Seattle, where my demographics are (theoretically) much better, and have cautiously been testing the waters here. I have gotten a surprising number of likes and messages, but 95% of them have been from men who apparently didn't bother to read any part of my profile. I state pretty unequivocally that I am 1) very, very childfree and will not date a single dad, and 2) that I am very, very monogamous and hetero and will not date a poly man or a couple, and yet it seems like every other person who messages me is a parent of small children, and/or a couple looking for a unicorn, and/or a dude in an \"open relationship\" (right...). Surely there are some single people in this city who are not poly, right? So that has been pretty irritating and a waste of time trying to sort through all that. I also seem to be very attractive to the pathologically nerdy 40-year-old-virgin neckbeard contingent, which is also not what I am looking for (although I dig non-socially-awkward, pro-hygiene geeks). \n\nOverall, I feel like I need to tweak my profile a bit to try to discourage the neckbeards, and probably send out some messages myself to a handful of the men in my area who actually seem like they might be a good match for me (no kids, profile pics don't make them look like they sleep with a waifu pillow).\n\nShockingly, I also met and spent several hours talking/flirting with my super attractive real-world neighbor last week (was starting to think there were no actual single men my age left in the non-online world), but was an idiot and failed to give/get a number at the end of the night and haven't seen him around the building since then. Was considering trying to figure out when he walks his dog and \"accidentally\" running into him. He has part-time teenage daughters, though, so I kind of have mixed feelings about it.","I think it'd help if you answered more questions. The question/answer system still remains unique to okcupid and 15 questions answered is not enough to make use of it.\n  \nOne tip I can give for it: while okcupid will constantly nag at you to mark questions unacceptable, always think hard \"is this a deal breaker or not?\" \n  \nFor example: it propably wouldn't be worth marking their answer to liking scary films as unacceptable, but something like wanting poly relationships could be a deal breaker.\n  \nOnly try to answer questions that matter to you, too many worthless questions isn't a good idea either. I think around 100+ question answers makes good use of the system.","I know it is really hard because I can relate as many others here can. In my situation, I fell completely in love with a guy who I dated for three months, but he started to become very distant and more active on OKC again towards the end of our relationship. It was hard on me because we actually built something over the course of those 3 months. \n\nI finally came to terms that the healthiest thing for me to do was to move on. It took me time to stop thinking about him during other dates, but it is fine now. I met him in early 2016.\n\nToday, I still miss him when I think about him so much so that it starts to feel as fresh as the day I walked away. He lives in an apartment that I unfortunately have to drive by whenever I come back from a day out of my city which causes a bit of pain when I see his car. I know I made the healthiest decision for myself at the end of the day.\n\nI really think you too should move on.","I'm a little late to the party, hopefully you get these. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overview:** You have a profile that is lacking some personality as is. While better than others, it falls into some of the same troupes and fails to sell yourself. That's what you are doing, selling yourself as a human, so you need to plaster some of your whit, humor, and personality in these questions. If you answer them with self deprecating humor and basic answers you come off as a guy who is boring and doesn't like himself. You got to sell yourself more. Also, what type of girl do you want? Like what do you want to do with her and what places do you want to go with her? Sprinkle that in there too, if I'm a girl I don't know who your are or what you're looking for reading this. Those are big things to add in.  Also, picture game is more important than all the text, you should add those too. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Self Summary:** This is too self deprecating and gives me nothing unique from other guys on the site. This is a resume for you, sell yourself better. Introduce yourself, describe the things you think are important to you, put a joke in there, and let it sit. Go on profiles of guys in your age range and see what they are putting and step up your game a bit. This is also a place you can say what you are looking for quick, or drop hints. Also, many people who use the word \"sarcastic\" to describe themselves can be dick, regardless if you are or not, I know many girls who see that and click away right away.  \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I'm Doing:** Come on man, you got more going on then just college. You mentioned \"long days work\", do you work? If you do it means you try at life and have some money, so it's good to add too. You're still self deprecating and you got to own your passions; that humor *may* work in real life, but it comes off poorly on dating sites. I'm an engineer, so Landscape Arch isn't bad to me and women who are looking for a dude who is smart will love it. A better way to spin that is *\"Scratching my knowledge itch by finishing up my degree in landscape arch. If you think that engineering is a bit too spicy, I'm the man for you with some great architecture facts.\"* Or something, it gives personality and says you have pride in your work. If you do anything else put it here, you're more than a student. Adding something from \"finishing up another Terry Prachett book\" to \"trying to find the best thai place around (or whatever food you like)\" to will add spice to this and make you more interesting. Again, you're selling yourself so spice it up.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'm really good at:** No offense, I read this twice and didn't remember what you wrote. The \"Uh\" to start off is still self deprecating, just start off your list. This is a hard section for most people and you too I'm guessing because it is boastful when you've been pretty chill in your profile. You can put non-personal things like \"Bill Walsh football '95 on the Sega Genesis\" if it's not easy or go into more detail about the things you did say. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Golden Rule:** It's fine, I understand it but not super into it. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Media:** I disagree with others here because this section tells me a lot about if I will like the girl. If she likes Radiohead or likes Arrested Development, I'm game. I agree a concise list is best, though. This is your profile, but I would put a little personality into your list. Girls I liked have also had good media sections because media has a lot to do with what you do in your down-times with each other. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Six Things:** This section is usually lame to me and hard to make a good one. You get points for not putting \"water, cell phone, family\" etc here, but it isn't a strong list. My GF put folding shirts the best way, the oxford comma, and then star wars references in hers and it attracted me hard; yours is a single joke gone too long. I agree with others, cut it out or re-do it. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thinking about:** Some of these are good (Trex, Gryffindor, director) while others to me, as someone older, come off as someone who is trying to sound deep (\"the mind has no limits\", nature of time, existential thought, changing the world). It is personality, which helps the profile, but to me it paints a picture of someone saying their deep which is not cool. I tend to not like longer lists too, and this one seems too long (maybe add bullets?).\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Friday Night:** This is boring and is exactly like every other profile. What do you do and how do you chill are important, unless it's netflix and a movie because that's basic. This is another way to show yourself off and describe what you want out of your date.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Message Me:** This is okay too, but not my style. Rule of thumb is to put an idea or two about dates here for the person. You can say something like \"You can message me if you like to try some good mexican food or teach a grown man how to drink coffee because I haven't learned how to yet\"; that will put the idea of a date in their mind more. I'd ditch the \"you like me\" line because it's obvious and maybe the first lines too (I'm not you and not sure what type of girl you are trying to get, so maybe keep it?). ","You're a real mixed bag, brother. You have some great stuff and some things that throw up flags.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall:** Not bad, you paint a picture of yourself which is better than many people who post or what I see when I use to browse OKC. I am not sure what you are trying to portray yourself as, but what I read in general is someone who thinks they are very intelligent and works very hard to prove that point. If that isn't want you're going for, you'll have a lot of work to do I think. A profile at it's core is trying to attract the type of person you want to you and I get a lot of pretension in some of these replies. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pictures:** The most important part of the profile, your main is great and really most of these are better than I see. However, you are alone in every one of them and are wearing the same shirt in like 4 of them. The first one is good, which gets people to click; then it seems weird to have so many solo pictures that look like you are taking selfies (because you are in a few, just subtly). I personally would keep #1, #4, #7, #3 (in that order) and then get a picture with friends or an animal. For a poly dude, you're too solo in these. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Self Summary:** This may be a regional thing, but when I read the first line I thought, \"Oh, don't usually see any gay men doing critiques on here\" and didn't notice I was wrong until I saw the orientation. Having \"queer classicist\" start it out puts that in my mind right away and in the online dating world, you don't get much time. Your main pic gets people to click your profile, so don't lose them right away by thinking you selected the wrong gender you're looking for (again, maybe it's regional, but google-ing that phrase just backs up my first thought). Other than that, in general I don't like repeating information in profiles, you list being poly three times, being classicist twice (just the intro), being charitable two to three times, and that you have a masters twice. I would consider taking out the last sentence to clean that up. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current Goal:** If you removed the last sentence from the opening, you can take the \"working in the city\" line to the first part so *Right now I am working in the city in the hopes to save up enough money to get my PhD in \\_\\_\\_\\_* works nicely. I'm anal, so when you list seven goals when the heading is for one my eye twitches; however not horrible. Maybe after your main goal, I would say *In the meantime, to keep myself on other goals, I...* \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Beat you at:** I love the last sentence, it is fake-self deprecating and works well. The first sentence to me is all trash bin worthy (maybe not the dad jokes line). When I said the pretentious thing in the overall section, this is what I mean. You want to brag about reciting a boring medium (erotic poetry) in a dead language. I'm not your target audience, but interpretive dancing is a very esoteric thing to add and you lead off with cocktails while later talking about going to a bar. I think I get the essence of what you want to show off of yourself without these lines and I feel they only hinder.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Golden Rule:** Good job here. Better than most, again. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Media:** This section I can tell what you're trying to get across, but it comes off as pretty pretentious again despite the humor. Depending on the person you're trying to get, I would simplify this a bit, say something like: *I'm a huge cinephile who can obsess over Nouvelle Vague, neo-realism, or all kinds of queer cinema as just as well as I can the latest Marvel release.* It isn't great, but it takes a little of the bluntness away. I personally fell for a girl who had something simpler that said \"I try to watch one movie a day\" and listed her favorite directors. Also, the last sentence is worded oddly. Like the last section, I think you give off who you are enough without having to drop Zizek at all.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**I Value:** Good here, paints you without being over the top. Gives an idea about who you're looking for, all good. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Think about:** These are all pretty decent, a good section like the last. Tells the reader about you with a bit of humor. It is long, so I'd think about cutting one or two out. This is the 2nd of 3 times you mention Polyamory; I'd consider taking one or two of the references out (important to keep one over your relationship settings). Maybe cut the butter one for time, weakest of the lot. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**A Perfect Day:** This is good stuff. A bit long winded again, asking for one day and you give three. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**If I were sent to jail:** Decent hook, something is weird with the wording to me about buying you a drink, but it may be regional again. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I'm looking for:** Definetly kill that last line, everyone knows about the likes and writes that. The first section is weird, I'd kick the any gender off because you dating settings don't filter men into your profile, or it doesn't look that way. Are you looking for just friends, honestly? If not, take that whole thing out, if so, move it to the last. Your second sentence is better and you should lead with it. The thing about polyamory shows up again and I don't think it is hard to understand anything, so I would take it out if you haven't taken the other references out. It's in your dating preferences and your intro, if the person doesn't notice it, they will on the first date. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;","Okay, I'm going to go point by point, I would seriously put more effort into these and think about how you want to represent yourself because I don't think it is showing you how you think it is.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pictures**: These *are* good, but they all look like you took them with-in 3 mins of each other. I would highly suggest taking a picture with friends or in a social environment to give the impression that you are not a loner.  You're fresh out of a relationship so many pics you have are as a couple, we all have been there, I used the advice in the sidebar [to just take my own pictures that](https://imgur.com/a/DztSuig) were better than my friends would take; it seems lame but works. \n\n**Self Summary:**  Again, good info but you have have three \"ands\" in just one sentence. You live in a good city and something small like bad grammar could make a girl not keep looking at your profile. End the first sentence after \"feelings\" and put a comma after \"hit me up\" and it runs a lot better. \n\n**What you're doing:**  Honesty is good, but this is too much of a view behind the curtain. You're 27, most people have just been out of a LTR or divorced, so you don't have to shed too much light in the dark areas. Also, you already mentioned \"having a lot of feelings\" in the section before that could be interpreted as a flag to some and this is like saying \"in case you didn't get it, here it is again in bold font\". Regardless if you may not feel comfortable to meet someone upfront, don't say that, it's like saying \"I may not perform well in bed, I may, but I may not\". \n\nI would pretty much scrap all the first paragraph and actually put time into the second one to let people know what you're doing. \"I am just out of a marriage and am juggling working through that with actual work where I \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" isn't a great start, but it throws up far less flags to anyone interested. \n\n**Golden Rule:** This section could win a marathon for it's run on length. I kinda get the vibe, but I would put effort into making it make sense. It's a golden rule so it should be apparent.\n\n**Media:** This is like looking at a wall of text to me. I would suggest two things: organize and compress. I can't tell when you're talking about books or movies and it all flows into music and food: Use paragraphs for each section: books, movies/tv, music, and then food. If someone likes Brazil, they like PKD and Hitchhiker’s. It is redundant and with all this I don't know which you **love** and what you think are suppose to be cool. A profile that says \"*While waiting for Philip K Dick to make another movie I spend time watching anything from Brazil to MGS4 to The Hobbit. Although I am never too busy to splurge on some The 5th Element or Bojack Horseman\"* gives off way way more personality than a list and tells me more about you. I would also get rid of the dumped/divorce line, you can modify it as \"good break up music\" instead but bringing up it at all sends off red flags that you're not ready to get out there again.\n\n**Hobbies/A perfect Day/Jail:** All three of these are super low effort and no punctuation even. It not only shows you are not putting effort into dating long term, but comes off as un-original. Even very good looking girls don't get away with \"uh I'm not gonna say that here am i\" line, it is a question to have fun with. For someone who says they value humor you should show it with examples.\n\n**What I'm looking for:** Oh lordy. \"Someone who can pull me out of my comfort zone\" sounds like a chore to me. \"or  literally anyone who actually wants to be monogamous and won’t change their mind after 3 years\" Is a flashing red light of a flag that I could guide an airplane with, this comes off as woman cheat and change their minds and mixed with other stuff you've already edited (\"kicking my cheating wife to the curb\") tells me you're probably not ready for this. Be honest with this. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall:** Man, you have an instagram filled with photography and your dog but don't mention it in the profile. This isn't showing the guy you are presenting in your insta, and even after edits your profile still screams that you are not over our ex (you literally said \"cheating wife\" instead of \"ex wife\"). As a human, I would suggest that you don't need to \"date\", use tinder to get out there and get over her. You have a huge opportunity to find someone who is better than before and make life better, but if that person sees this profile, they will not see the person you really are. I saw t[his video by Beck Bennett on SNL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mbp0DugfCA) and it covers where you're at to me: you have to work on yourself and take time before it works. I ruined a few good relationships after my marriage thinking I was ready when I wasn't. You won't believe me since I'm a stranger on the internet, try to work through your shit before you put it on someone else. Good luck, man.","This is legitimately one of the worst profiles I've ever seen. Let's start with the good: you're a writer, and went to school for that (?). You like music, do you play an instrument? Do you have a dog? You should include that in your profile if you do. You can write enthusiastically. You're tall.\n\nNow the bad (just listing the worst parts here):\n\nFirst picture is trash. In the second picture you look like you're 55. The way you look in the 4th photo is best, but I'd actually include the third one because the band looks less annoyed by you. Get rid of the rest, you don't need multiple with the same band. Not a good photo with the dog. You look creepy, he looks uncomfortable. In the last one you look about 14.\n\nYou would be a lot better looking if you grew out a beard to about 1cm and groomed it well. I have a friend with your facial shape and it really works for him.\n\nYour self-summary is the only part a lot of people will read, it should be the highlights from your profile. Redo it at the end.\n\n&amp;gt;build up some paper, saving up for some new wheels\n\nThis is really awkward. If this is actually how you talk that's fine, otherwise try to write like a normal person so you don't repulse people. \n\n&amp;gt;It's not like I went to college for writing or anything, right?? Oh wait...\n\nDid you? We don't know. Didn't you learn in 6th grade to write to a no-nothing audience, much less while majoring in writing? Also this is a good example of a joke that could be funny in person if delivered correctly, but is bad when read on a profile.\n\nRemove all mentions of alcohol from your profile unless you want to mention your favorite drink in the food section. The way you talk about it sounds unhealthy and is a red flag.\n\nFavorites section should be about 1/4 of the length. No one is going to read all of that. Condense it down to the things that you can get excited about, but are popular enough that your target audience will recognize them and message about it.\n\nWhy the hell do you still use a Zune? Do you not have a smart phone? That would be a red flag for me.\n\nRemove the mystery item. It's not really funny. Try to add something that says something about you but still has some humor to it. The tea candles were a pretty good one. The rest of the list is okay. \n\n&amp;gt;How A1 my foundation is\n\nWhat?\n\n&amp;gt;At the post office, like I am every Friday. Man I wish there was an easier way to mail my letters than standing in line for 4 hours!\n\nI'm guessing this is a joke? But I don't know what it's supposed to say about you.\n\n&amp;gt;Steven Segall's solo albums &amp;gt; his movies\n\nSure whatever.\n\n&amp;gt;Actually I will settle for you just having alcohol\n\nAgain remove all the alcohol references. This is your last chance to sway someone's opinion! Remind them of a highlight from your profile, give a conversation starter, or suggest a cool date idea.","OK this is going to be a wall of text and I won't go over grammar/syntax but I'll do my best.\n\n**For pics:**\n\n- I like 4 the most because it's a good smiling pic, but it also isn't the greatest because it's cropped and you're not centered (which is understandable since it's cropped). 2 I think is also good, and while 1 &amp;amp; 3 give a good idea of what you look like, you've got a nice smile, and I think it'd be best to replace those two with similar but smiling pics.\n\n\n**For your self-summary:**\n \n- I'd maybe expand on some stuff. Maybe add why you're studying psychology, what you want to do with it, w/e - the rest of the summary seems to have a good sense of humor, so even if it's to say you just want to up your people watching game I think that'd be fine.\n\n- What kind of workouts do you like to do? Do you occasionally dabble in yoga/cycling/rowing/whatever?\n\n- Maybe think of creative names for your goldfish, just to put them in here.\n\n- What games are you currently enjoying? This and the movie portion below may be best in the favorites section, but I haven't gotten there yet.\n\n**What I'm doing with my life:**\n\n- Talk about your dream! And what you'd like to go to grad school for. \n\n**I'm really good at:**\n\n- I'd change \"stupid stuff\" to \"random topics\" at the very least, because hey, if you can ramble about it it's probably not stupid to you.\n- This is the first mention of wanting to go into counseling, which isn't a bad place for you to mention it, but I think you can definitely go into it in your self summary/what you're doing with your life.\n\n**The first thing people notice:**\n\n- I'll allow it, flows well with the rest of the personality you've got going on.\n\n**A book everyone should read:**\n\n- Maybe add in why you like this book.\n\n**Six things:**\n\n- I seem to have had some luck with short descriptions for why I need each thing. I've got \"Bluetooth headphones: never again will my phone fall to certain death while lifting again\" in my profile and have gotten some mentions from it. Side note: what's your favorite hot pocket?\n\n**I spend a lot of time thinking about:**\n\n- love it\n\n**On a typical Friday:**\n\n- looks good\n\n**Private thing:**\n\n- looks good\n\n**Message if:**\n\n- I like the last two parts, I'd personally put \"you're picking up what I'm putting down\", but whatever, that's not necessary. I'd maybe add in like \"You're looking for a Ukelele instructor\" or something else you've mentioned in your profile.\n\n\n\n","100&amp;amp;#37; remove the bike helmet and shotgun pictures. Also add one that shows that you're fit, because the only picture that hints at your  physique make it look like you've got a belly. You look super stiff in the rest of your photos, and they all look like they were taken in your apartment. Get outside, loosen up, and smile.\n\nAge range is  a red flag, even if someone falls in your range they'll likely get turned off by it when they see it on your profile. You can always filter manually, just don't put it in the \"looking for\" section.\n\nCalling yourself a banana and twinkie? Come on man, I don't think anyone likes that weird racial shit. If I was curious whether you were born in the US I could check your languages. \n\nMost of the rest of the profile is pretty boring. Show, don't tell applies to most of the summary. Many broad, generalized and boring statements like \"feel very fortunate to have had a great experience blah bah.\" I got bored transcribing it. For example on your perfect day, instead of saying you like \"new things\" and feeling accomplished \\(so does everyone\\), give us an example of the best day you've had in the past year. You can combine a couple of your favorite moments from the past year into one day, no one is going to fault you because the question was hypothetical anyway. Show off your storytelling skills, creativity, or humor. \n\nI would remove references to fashion from the profile, or get better pics displaying your fashion. The fashion in your pics is boring, and I don't really see a particular style besides a lack of color and a hint of a neckbeard\\-esque retro\\-formal aesthetic. \n\nName\\-dropping men's fashion lines isn't going to earn you points with women. Tailor your profile to your desired audience, not yourself.\n\nAll in all, try to get rid of the stuff that likely applies to large groups of people and give us more specific info about what makes you unique. ","---Biggest three things to change---\n\nPic sucks. Set up a timer or something and take one from farther away so your face isn't so distorted. Also go outside. There are so many cool places in Miami, just find a spot you like and ask someone to take a picture for you. Repeat until you get one you like.\n\n&amp;gt;single women, ages 18‑24, new friends\n\nWhat is this? Are you looking for friends or a date? Choose one and stick with it. Also a 22 year old dude who will date or hang out with a highschooler but not a 25 year old is creepy, change your age range.\n\n&amp;gt;Moved to Miami less than two years ago and left most of my friends behind.\n\nThis sounds really pathetic, don't include negative stuff like this and certainly don't lead with it. The way you said it, it sounds like you've been living in Miami for two years and you still don't have any friends. Huge red flag.\n\n---Smaller stuff---\n\n&amp;gt;I'm shy at first but I'll find my way as time goes by , highly empathic and optimistic.\n\nDon't say it, show it. This kind of stuff is worthless because everyone likes to think it about themselves and no one will believe it about others unless you give them a reason to.\n\n&amp;gt;I'm mainly looking for someone I can talk to (trying to expand my social life a bit , new friends are welcome! ) and actually hear back from them which is just as Important. My Ideal date would be somewhere calm enough so conversation can flow but not calm enough to fall asleep.\n\nAgain, a mixture of obvious stuff no one wants to read and generic statements that don't define what you're looking for. Do you want a friend? Why do you only include single women then? Do you want to date? Why isn't that included in \"looking for\"?\n\nAs a general rule don't mention gaming or working out. Unless there's something very specific inside those that you think you could use to connect with people, such as a funny story about the gym or a game you're excited to play or something, it's only going to hurt your profile.\n\n&amp;gt;hanging out with friends.\n\nBe specific or don't say it.\n\nI really like the dream job statement, people love it when you show passion. I want to know what your current job is though, and how you're working towards this dream job. People will always assume the worst with those kinds of things.\n\n&amp;gt;You name the challenge , I'll take it and try my best to beat you.\n\nBoring and weirdly aggressive. Remove or improve.\n\n&amp;gt;My eyes\n\nI don't believe you. Come up with something more interesting, or that's at least believable considering the fact that we have a picture of your unremarkable eyes at the top of the page.\n\n&amp;gt;Gatsby ,\n\nYou have this weird formatting all over your profile and it looks super sloppy.\n\n\"I value\" section is fine.\n\n&amp;gt;How to improve at whatever I'm doing\n\nBoring but w/e. Would be better to give some interesting examples from the last day or something.\n\n&amp;gt;No Friday is typical...\n\nSo deep. If your Fridays are so interesting tell us about them.\n\n&amp;gt;You feel like we could get along\n\nAgain more noncommittal BS. Tell us what you want. Also a good spot to throw in a conversation starter or reiterate a strong point from your profile (such as the chef thing).\n\n&amp;gt;come on don't be shy, leave that to me :P\n\nI realize this is part of who you are, but I'm a lot less likely to message someone if I think they'd be too shy to message me back. I would remove this. ","**My Self Summary**\n\nI make music, websites, and the occasional witty remark.\n\nI think I just want what everyone else wants: To come home after a hard day of work and be greeted at the door by my love. They'll take me by my hand, lead me to the bedroom and whisper those three words I've been longing to hear: \"no safe word\".\n\n... herrRegen on FL ��\n\n\n**What I'm Doing With My Life**\n\nMaking records. Check 'em out:\n\nPinot &amp;amp; The Noirs on Spotify\n\nI wanted to name my band Mark Bench and The Benchmarks, but was actually concerned if it took off and I achieved any level of notoriety, people would start calling me Mark, kinda like what was happening to Hootie for a while. So now they'll just have to call me Pinot.\n\nProfessionally, I am a web developer, which is awesome (and why my profile is formatted nicely). I love that I can create things for a living, even if those things only live as 0's and 1's inside a metal box in a data center somewhere in the midwest.\n\n**I'm Really Good At**\n\n* Using the term \"staunch advocate\" to show approval.\n* Making bulleted lists. I'm a little surprised \"bulleted\" isn't a real word.\n* Playing devil's advocate; by which I mean placing my copy of the movie starring Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves into the DVD player and pressing 'play'.\n\n**The First Thing People Usually Notice About Me**\n\n:beard_guy_emoji:\n\n**Favorite Books, Movies, Etc**\n\nFavorite Music:\nYou throw a shit-ton of reverb on a dozen guitar tracks, add some tremolo and ethereal vocals, and I'll listen to that shit on repeat. Current favorites are: Trementina, Ringo Deathstarr, Beach House.\n\nAlso: The Velvet Underground, My Bloody Valentine, The Kinks, Ty Segall, Ezra Furman, HAIM, Jeffrey Lewis, John Cale, Alice in Chains, Nick Cave, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones.\n\nFavorite Books:\nThe House of the Spirits, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Breakfast of Champions, Fox in Socks.\n\nHowever, I mostly read textbooks about JavaScript these days. ☹️\n\nFavorite Movies:\nDunston Checks In\n\nFavorite Food:\nI eat almost anything and everything (that's not too spicy ��). I particularly love recipes that feature a lot of butter and garlic. I cook a few times a week and make a mean Chicken Francese, boss pan-seared tuna steaks with tahini, and the dankest tuna casserole.\n\nFavorite Board Games:\nI'm currently mid-campaign in Arcadia Quest and absolutely crushing it. I'm also a staunch advocate of Smash Up!, Splendor, Betrayal at the House on the Hill, Deception, Settlers of Catan, Star Realms, Code Names, Secret Hitler, and Pandemic. I'm always looking for suggestions on what to try next!\n\n**Six Things I Could Never Do Without**\n\n* Spotify.\n* Quiet time to think / relax.\n* My .vimrc.\n* Animals, specifically fox pups.\n* Staunch advocacy. Is the joke old yet? ��\n* A belt. Seriously, I don't feel like myself without one on. I even keep an emergency belt in my car in case I ever leave the house without one.\n\n**I Spend a Lot of Time Thinking About**\n\nWhat I would do if I went to a comedy show and someone pulled me on stage and forced me to do standup. Here's what I've got so far: \"What's the deal with Kevin Bacon? Is he an actor or a food?\"\n\nAlso, death.\n\n**On a typical Friday night I am**\n\n...having some drinks, maybe going to a concert on the LES, or playing darts in some dive. I'd be just as happy to bust out some grotesque dance moves or show off my slightly-above average geography knowledge at bar trivia.","Still way too generic. Things like calling yourself open-minded, relaxed, imperfect, saying you love to learn, that you're working on procrastination, etc. are things everyone would say about themselves. Other things like saying you're a \"Team Leader\" and working on \"personal projects\" are incredibly uninteresting and so broad that they're somewhat suspicious. \n\nYou also need to work on your language. Passive, generic, non-committal language makes you boring. Some examples just from your self-summary: pretty, things, pretty, quite a bit, often, feel like it, \"doing work,\" just, and stuff. You get the idea. Use action words and be specific. \n\n\"Something crunchy\" is the only interesting thing on your six things list. Try to think outside the box and come up with stuff beyond the generic \"computer\" or \"cold side of the pillow.\" What unusual household object do you use everyday? Are there any quirky rituals you follow or things you do to unwind? Maybe instead of \"Music\" you could say something about your favorite source for new tunes, or instead of \"Computer\" tell us what aspect of it is indispensable (e.g. Lots of RAM for my photo editing, or A big monitor I can rotate so I can watch my shows from bed). These sections are great for mentioning stuff that might feel shoehorned in elsewhere.\n\n&amp;gt;Doesn't want to date.\n\nNo shit.\n\n&amp;gt;I will always try to be fair\n\nYawn.\n\nCut the media section down to around a quarter of its current size. I took the time to type all this out and not even I can be bothered to read all that. No one on OKC is going to either.","As a native San Diegan now uprooted, I feel an unusual amount of duty to give you tough love, because I think you have lots of potential, but it's being wasted. \n\nMike: You're a (quite) handsome tall dude, but your photos don't show that at all. They're terrible. Your profile pic is dark and far away, and the very next pic is of the exact same scene. 2 of your photos are of caterpillars... nobody is interested in looking at those on a first impression.  You can *significantly* improve everything by just looking up a wikihow on taking a good selfie, following the instructions, and then making that your profile pic.  In an ideal world, you'd have a good photo that was just taken organically, but a quality selfie is still leagues better than what you've got so far. \n\nI like your self-summary. It makes me want to cuddle with you (no homo, I mean this only in the manliest of ways two men could share). As a side note, we should be friends. \n\nThat said, the summary is a little long. Scrap the data-driven section. Move the \"looking for\" paragraph to the \"message me if\" section. \n\n**What I'm doing with my life**\n\n&amp;gt;TL;DR: getting my shit together.\n\nNo. Don't be a project. Be a success story. Get rid of this. If you're actually getting your shit together, phrase it in a way that shows you're growing, but you already accept yourself. As it is, it comes across as self-deprecating in a not-so-flattering way. \n\nThe rest reads as an long auto-biography with no end in sight. You have some admirable life events, but they're buried in sad details nobody will want to read (except me, because I've decided I love you and want to see you succeed). \n\nCut it *way* down, and just focus on the uplifting components. You want your reader to feel good, not sorry for you. Talk about how you're taking care of your grandma because you love her. Mention how carpentry fills your creativity needs, and you've undertaken psychiatry because you like to help people. You can do that in 3-4 sentences without the sad accompanying story. \n\n**I'm really good at**\n\nYou've taken an opportunity to brag and turned it into a way to insult yourself. If you were trying for humor, it read as a more sincere self-deprecation. Is that *really* all you're good at? Why would you tell the future love of your life that all you have to offer her is pedantic messages? Don't you want to craft things for her? Care for her? Cuddle and talk late into the night with her? Find a way to brag about *that* stuff. \n\n**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food** \n\nNobody will want to read this essay. I don't even want to read what *I've* written for mine, and mine is super short. TBH this section is terrible on OkC. It's (in theory) a great opportunity to find things in common, but it's often misused and turned into a boring laundry list or life story. You've opted for the latter.  For example, turn this: \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;I do not watch many movies but the Marvel properties, especially Deadpool, Captain America, and anything involving Black Widow, are awesome. Wonder Woman is about the only thing I like from DC and, unless they bring that director back for more movies, I expect it to stay that way.\n \nInto \"I'm a big fan of superhero movies.\" Same message, less reader fatigue. \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;My current favorite show is Forged In Fire, of which I cannot say enough good things; the judges are all hilarious characters and it is awesome to watch smiths work their trade. Others shows I have enjoyed include White Collar, Burn Notice, House, Sherlock, Doctor Who, CSI, NCIS, Covert Affairs, Suits, Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU, and all manner of anime (bonus points for anyone familiar with Aria). Game of Thrones is fun to watch with friends and alcohol but recent seasons have lost me a bit.\n\n\"Forged in Fire: all time fave right now, but I'm also really into crime/mystery television. Just waiting for that Season 5 of Sherlock.\" Write it in your own voice, but you get the idea. \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;My favorite places to eat are, in no particular order, Rita's Mexican Food in El Cajon, Himalaya in La Mesa, Tender Greens in UTC, and Extraordinary Desserts next to Balboa Park. I generally prefer pork and chicken over beef, though I am partial roasts and the very occasional steak.\n\nYou failed to mention Roberto's so I disown you as a child ;). In any case, either don't list this at all, or find a more interesting way to do so. From my experience, listing personal facts is just plain boring, which is why I think most people suffer so much on this section. \"I like X over Y\" is the least interesting way to say anything, and nobody will care. Even now I'm not sure why anyone would want to know why you like pork and chicken over beef. That should just be a fact that happens in the organic way of discovery. If you feel strongly about it, say something like \"I'm working on a gofundme to scientifically prove what I already know to be true: chicken and pork are the superior meats.\" \n\n**Six things I could never do without**\n\nAnother section I see lots of people over-write in. Don't list your phone as a necessary thing, unless you want to make it funnier (like, \"I need to have GrubHub near me at all times\"). Don't include \"a vehicle.\" Literally everyone in Southern California can't live without a vehicle because everything is at least 10 miles away from everything else. The rest are ok... but you add lots of personal details that don't add to your character in a meaningful way. \n\n**I spend a lot of time thinking about**\n\nBe specific not generic here. \"Politics\" is a category on a CNN tab. \"How on earth Trump still has a working phone that's connected to the internet\" is an interesting, engaging thought. You also spelled \"rational\" wrong here, which is probably the worst place to make that kind of mistake :/. \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Stupid Songs\n\nInstead of what you wrote, why not say something like \"how to get those damn repeat songs out of my head\" (or name an annoying song). Show, don't tell. \n\n**On a typical Friday night I am**\n\nYou don't have to fill this out. If all you're doing is something that doesn't add to your strengths, don't include it. Personally, as a fellow introvert, I take the opportunity to make it clear I like quality-time and intimate settings. \n\n**The most private thing I'm willing to admit**\n\nCharlie Brown is not sexy or attractive. Openness and humility are, but your admission goes *way* too far on both accounts. Leave this section blank or admit to something else. \n\n**You should message me if**\n\nGet rid of what you have and move that paragraph from above to down here. \n\n&amp;gt;I am honestly at a loss for what to do with OKC at this point. It is clear to me that I do not know how to handle this online dating thing and I not getting better as I age. I am open to any and all insights, particularly from those willing to engage and answer questions.\n\nHey man, first of all: online dating sucks. It's just terrible, and I hate it. But second of all, getting \"good at it\" in my experience requires building self-confidence, a voice, and (unfortunately) learning what makes the best profiles. There's lots of articles out there as to what will help. It sounds like \"gaming the system\" at first, but once you realize it's just advice used to help show your *best* self (the person you already are), it's worth reading up on. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy takeaways (in case you aren't interested in reading my entire dissertation on your feedback ;)): \n\n1. Show more, tell less. You're just listing lots of facts. That doesn't grip people. \n2. Buck up and present yourself more positively. If you can't do that, work on yourself first and then come back to online dating. People like being around people that make them feel good. Nobody wants to be around someone who conveys a \"feel sorry for me\" vibe. \n3. Get better pictures of yourself. You have a dog and a handsome face. You should be acing this section.

My parents have a similarly progressive view of marriage and it’s more about introducing me to people or knowing a friend of a friends that they feel comfortable about me meeting, rather than swiping left or right on random apps. But I am on an Indian dating site as well as several of the common American dating sites. My parents while they prefer that I marry an Indian, I do have the freedom of marrying outside the culture so if that is not an option/desire for you, I can also understand a reason to go the “setup route”.\n\nSomething that stood out for me while reading all the comments here was your reply to whenever you were asked about why you were interested in having the arranged marriage. You commented several times that you felt like you were ready, you’re educated, and you have a good job and you’ve gotten over previous relationships. As someone who has gone through relationships because I thought it was the natural next step or because I thought that it would fill a void or because I was sick of dating, there’s something in your comments that worries me. And that is, have you spent enough time with yourself to really know who you are and what you want? It seems like you’ve only been actively dating for two or three years and you also had a terribly unfortunate relationship where you were mistreated and abused. I realize that you have gotten help for that, but I think that that would give you pause and think about settling down and taking the time to really heal, to know what you want, to have the confidence and the resilience to do things that are beyond your comfort zone and really have a good relationship with yourself before you go and settle down with someone else. Even if you do go this route, it’s going to take time to make the right decision and you very likely will have a lot of the same experiences that you were having on Tinder or OKC, unless you would want to make a quicker decision as some traditional families do; meeting a guy a few times and the families agreeing. And god forbid you have another situation like your previous abusive one. But as someone who has gone through a tremendous amount of loss including the loss of my ex fiancé and the loss of my femininity and the loss of my fertility because of cancer, I found new perspective in what it means to be ready to settle down. And as an Indian female who has a lot of the same pressures, potentially, and probably some of the same conversations that you do with your parents, I’d like to offer you a slightly different perspective. \n\nPerhaps you feel like having a good job and education and feeling done with these major phases of your life is enough to get married and if that’s how you feel, I fully encourage you and support you to do whatever you think is right. But I have always been someone who while I would love to find my future partner and settle down for life, I’m not willing to settle and I’m not willing to give into pressure or not feel complete and whole before I look for a partner or decide on a partner to be with. I feel like there’s a lot more to be done in this day and age than get a job, go to college, and get married. But that’s how I feel, and I’m not trying to force my views or my version of things on you but I did want to share that I noticed this trend in your answers and I wanted to see if you noticed the same thing or what your thoughts are about what you really want and why you really want to get married and why you want to do it this way. The red pill shit is absolutely worthless and even other people’s opinions on where you should be or what you should be doing at this point in your life should not influence you. \n\nI’m a family doctor and I counsel a lot of young Indian women who jumped into marriage early or were forced into marriage and now are on the brink of depression and/or divorce. I’m not comparing their situation to yours but I see a lot of young men and women from ethnic communities want to get this part of their life over with or panic the minute they turn 30 and I just want to tell them that even if they do find a partner, life isn’t going to become suddenly really easy and beautiful and amazing. You and I have the experience to know that life throws different kinds of shit your way and if you’re not really invested in yourself, confident about who you are, or really know what you deserve and what you need, the conflicts that will come up in marriage will still end up being miserable failures because you won’t have the tools to tackle those issues. I was engaged and living with my ex for quite some time and I can now admit that I wanted to settle down with him in part, because it would fill some kind a void that I knew I had and it would force me to get away from the pressures of my parents and the shitty relationship I had with my parents but in the end, it didn’t work because I didn’t have the confidence to stand up for things, I didn’t know what I wanted and when shit got hard he bailed. So I write this long essay just to tell you to really think about what it is that you’re looking for and why you want to do this and make sure that your reasons are right and realize that there’s a lot more to life than getting married at 30 just because you hear horror stories in the media or because people have stupid comments they feel like they need to share with you about being married by 30\n\nLastly, I’d like to share a comment I made on another side where another female asked a very similar question as she approached 30 and thought she was “doomed“ because she had not found her SO and was genuinely anxious about the fact that she was alone before the age of 30. This is what I had to share with her:\n\n“I am 37, with a broken engagement; the ex left while I was in chemo. Because I went through a year’s worth of chemo and radiation for leukemia, I have lost my ability to have children. Despite doing a residency that required 70-80 hour work weeks, I met my ex who wasn’t in medicine (so despite the long hours you can meet people). After he left, I finished my medical residency and still moved to Boston where I didn’t know anyone despite the plan to move here with my ex. I have a dream fellowship in medical education and teach as as junior clinical faculty at two major medical schools in Boston. I have a loving family, a supportive group of friends, this amazing [pup](https://imgur.com/a/78D4M) and I still haven’t given up on finding love. I have hobbies, I travel and I recently started painting and Pilates. \n\nYou are so much than finding your SO by a certain time and I can tell you that life throws you so many curve balls along the way, that you’ll look back and wonder sometimes how you made it through. I can tell you life does not go as planned and finding your SO by 30 should be the least of your worries! Make something of yourself, live out your dream job, travel, see how people less fortunate than you live. Practice love, courage and resiliency. Find yourself. And when it’s time, you’ll find that other piece. I haven’t given up hope yet. Much love and luck to you! “","I already posted this but my boyfriend dumped me. Or really, by the end it was mutual. You can read my previous STS to know the backstory, but basically he was unsure of the relationship or if he even wanted a relationship, but we had a trip planned. Trip was fun.\n\nWhen we got back he wouldn't see me. We were still texting (which now I realize was a mistake). His takes became more and more infrequent. He was supposed to have a decision by Wednesday. By Wednesday I was miserable. Coming off of the high of the trip where he had been so funny and caring to him not wanting to see me, and clearly not trying to make it work... \n\nI texted him Wed and said today's the day. But he was sick and didn't want to talk. I had basically been letting him string me along, and I knew that if i didn't take control I'd probably still be strung along at this point. Thursday I told him I needed to see him. He was sick. I told him if he was just waiting to dump me to just do it, and he did. He said we moved too fast and we couldn't go back. He said that he had this feeling we wouldn't work and he couldn't get past it, that he never could before in other relationships. I told him it as a mistake, that he didn't even try. I asked him why he was so caring on the trip, even on the flight back, if he was just going to end it, and he said he hadn't decided at that point (Friday). \n\nFriday I just cried and cried. But yesterday I got drinks with a friend. Today I had lunch with another friend. I've transitioned from being sad to being angry. I'm aiming for 30 days of no contact. My friends seem to think that this is potentially salvageable, that he probably freaked out and didn't know what to do. At some point I will have to see him because I have his things. I hope to at least have a friendship with him (with benefits, let's be real). \n\nFeels bad man. Also I'm having a really hard time getting a job.","My dad was a physically and emotionally abusive meth addict/alcoholic (and his behavior seeped into my life, I have stories), my grandfather was a child molester, my \"step-dad\" was a malevolent power-hungry tyrant (also verbally and emotionally abusive). I grew up moving around a lot—at one point all of us (mom, me, + siblings) were living out of my uncle's garage and then my grandma's guest room (aka basically homeless), so keeping friends was hard. There's more but that's enough for now.\n\n&amp;gt; how did your fucking parents make you the miserable fucking sack you are today?\n\nCaveat: I'm not a sad sack and I'm the best possible version of myself I could ever be. I've found ways to forgive and love everyone in my family and there's been many years of reconciliation and healing. Family of origins is an important thing to consider, but don't let other people define who you are. \n\nedit: This seems as good a place as any to pitch /r/SelfCompassion. We may have had good reasons to learn to hate ourselves growing up, but there are ways to move past it now. ","I met a guy in September (off OkC). He told me on the first date that his wife died less than a year ago, but that he was sure he was ready to move on. The first month was great-he’s great, the sex is great-but their anniversary came and he went silent. We resume after a month and it’s great again, but then it’s the holidays and he needs space to get through it. We start up again, and now he’s moving out of their house and needs space to go through her things and he’s hurting, a lot. I understand but I feel like I’m the other woman to a ghost. It’s taken it’s toll on me and I can’t continue. But I don’t want to reach out now and just drop it on him. I don’t know what to do. It sucks because he’s beautiful and amazing and I feel he does like me, but it’s not healthy. \n\nI found more of my ex-bf’s things around the house. I was tempted to just mail them to his mother’s house and be done with it but that felt cowardly. So I agreed to meet him for breakfast this morning and holy hell, it hurt. I could barely look at his face. I’m over him in the sense that I don’t want him back but there are so many unresolved feelings. \n\nMy ex-boss, who I consider a friend, has stage 4 liver cancer. She’s alone-no husband, no kids, her only family is several states away. She’s starting chemo with no support but her cats and her job. She’s seems positive about it, but I’m scared for her. \n\n2017 was such a year of suffering for so many, and the shit just keeps on rolling. ","To me, marriage signifies a commitment between two people that is deeper than any other type of relationship- we'll encourage and support each other, help each other achieve personal or professional goals.  That, when things get difficult, we'll try our hardest to understand what is/ has happened, work through it, and remain together.\n\nYeah, I'd like to be married; I want someone to share this life with.\n\nRight now I'm largely indifferent to kids- if she really wants kids, I'd probably push for just having one.  Two at absolute max.  With all the issues at play today, particularly environmental issues, I think bringing a child or children into this future shit storm is kind of selfish.","&amp;gt; Having worked my way up the career ladder and done my share of seven-day weeks to fund the unpaid work that’s unfortunately a necessity in my field, I find myself absolutely livid at people who’ve never struggled.\n\nI feel that this is accusatory against people who have failed to succeed, but I have also done a lot of very hard work to build a life I'm proud of and really struggle to enjoy the company of people who can't take their lives in to their own hands.  \n\nI'm a man so my perspective is different than the author's.  I would end up being the stressed-out breadwinner if I got sucked in to that kind of shitty traditional gender roles relationship.  I don't means test my partners, but I also don't seriously date students or women without solid jobs. \n\nI'm absolutely not rich and I know that I'm 1-2 bad financial decisions from sliding in to poverty.  I can't take the chance on someone who might drag me down.  I've been with several women who could have done that but I had enough family and friend support to not make bad decisions.\n\nIt's not even about the person, poverty tends to twist people in knots through no fault of their own and even if someone were amazing, I can't tie myself to someone who has a family addicted to payday loans and cigarettes and lottery-winnings-retirement-planning.\n\nI see *so much* poverty and shitty life when I go back to my home town.  It's an economically depressed former steel city and people are just so broken there.  I don't think much honour survives precarious work, payday loans, drinking to forget your hopelessness.\n\n","Listen to your gut.\n\nYou say he's a \"wholesome individual\", but until you actually get to know him in person, you don't know that. You don't know anything about him. All you know is how he wants to present himself to the world in a Tinder bio. In your post you are listing lots of reasons for why you should ignore your misgivings and go to his place:\n\n* He has a kid, maybe he's not a sexual aggressor (Having kids isn't a magic switch that turns boundary-pushers into boundary-respecters)\n* I could have sex with him, maybe, if I wanted (You're already talking yourself out of your previously established boundary of wanting to try something different)\n* Going place with kids is hard (it's hard but not impossible)\n* I know his sister (ok, but you still don't know him)\n* My mom said I should (Your mom isn't you, and has not had your life experiences)\n\nI'm not saying the guy's a rapist - I'm just noticing that you're tying yourself in knots here trying to rationalize away your discomfort. When our gut feelings speak, it's important to listen. Just say that won't work for you, you prefer to meet in public. Not a big deal, especially for a first date.","My gf (who is now 48) had sex with a 14 year old guy when she was 21. She laughs about it. I told her if the sexes were reversed she'd be a registered sex offender.\n\nTo add more info (which will just fan the flames per the comments below)...\n\n1. She mentioned that she had a feeling that he was immature for his age. He told her he was 19-20 years old.\n2. It did cause a huge argument. My daughter (from a previous marriage) is 14. I said there was no freaking way I could ever mistake a 14 year old for a 20 year old.\n3. And here's the kicker....she found out his real age while out playing pool with him and some of his friends. One of them said \"So...what's it like dating a middle schooler?\" She did then break things off with the kid and discussed things with the kids mom. She offered (this still makes me cringe) to clean the moms home for her. She says that it was ok because her and the kids mom formed a connection (friendship). I told her that there are guys in jail that didn't get the offer to clean someones house to get out of what they did.\n4. She used the excuse \"He looked older than he was.\" I replied \"Which is what every guy who does the same thing to underage women says\".","1. I would remove the part about not being Indian. Women who are interested will read the sidebar info. Women who don't want to date Indians will probably not want to date Middle Eastern. If you want you could keep the part about being Middle Eastern but not spontaneously exploding so that it is still part of the narrative\n2. The main problem with the profile is that there is hardly any info. Having read to the end I still don't know what you do for a living and I can only name one of your hobbies (soccer).  Add a few good sentences each about each of these. Also, if you don't know what a question means then don't answer it. Your answer to the golden rule question make you seem both ignorant and rather lazy since you did not bother to Google this. In addition you should remove the part about not having goals: this exacerbates the issue of being seen as lazy. I am unsure why you think this is an attractive quality. You could keep the part about a good day being one without deadlines; this gets across the idea of someone who probably has interests and ambitions but also likes to chill out sometimes\n3. The second largest problem is that you have spent around 80% of your profile stating what you want in a woman rather than what you have to offer. It's also profoundly negative which might lead readers to believe that you have a negative view of women in general. I would replace this with a few sentences about stuff you would like to do together and what you are looking for in a relationship. Here are a few possible examples:\n\nA. I'm looking for a woman I can hang out with, watch movies and have fun without getting too serious\n\nB. I am looking for a woman who is outdoorsy and who wants to settle down and get married not too many years from now\n\nC. I am looking for a woman I can take out to bars, restaurants and stand up comedy and just see how things go\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps and apologies if it seems harsh","Honestly I'm trying to figure out how to get back into it. I've been \"on a break\" from it all, but for most of this year I've been back on my antidepressants and have been seeing a therapist about some things I've really needed to get off my chest.\n\nProblem is, I just can't get into online dating again (so what am I still doing here? I guess I enjoy the shitposting). I got back on Tinder, and despite having my profile and pics vetted by a couple of friends (both men and women), I haven't really had any luck. I'd like to think I'm not super picky. The \"new\" OKC, hate it. And Bumble is a shitshow in my opinion. So I'm trying to get around my social anxiety and find some solid ways to, at minimum, start expanding my social circle again, and maybe meet someone IRL. But that's proving easier said than done, considering I've basically barely existed outside of my apartment and office for like the last 2 years, after the constant disappointment that was my dating life in 2016.\n\nI'm doing my best to feel better about myself; I got back into bouldering at my local rock climbing gym, I do some weightlifting, I've been trying to update my wardrobe a little, and I found an amazing barber and asked him for some suggestions. I haven't been \"overweight\" in years, but even so I've lost some weight that didn't need to be there. Even if I sometimes have a hard time feeling/believing it, I look the best I've ever been, so if I can just get my emotions under control, surely something dating-wise should work out eventually. Well, I hope, anyway.","Having your Life Together, The Innovative Wombat Edition:\n\n* Having a sense of direction and ambition. You may not be in the career position you want now, but you're working towards it.\n* Saving towards a home or owning a home that doesn't leave you with $50 at the end of the month. You may not be ready to put down roots in a particular place, but you have a clear and defined plan towards that.

However, no plan at all for future housing stability and equity building isn't good.\n* Control over your vices.

If it is a casual relationship you could do this for the whole length of the relationship.\n\nBut if you are looking to find someone to settle down with then yes, eventually you are going to have to be willing to spend more time with that person. I mean, a permanent relationship would mean at least moving in together at some point, right? Which would mean spending at least a small amount of time together everyday (unless one of you is away on business or similar)?","I don't like having roommates either, but that's only because I like being alone. But living on your own costs $$$, having roommates to split the rent and bills makes much more financial sense, something this lady claims is important to her. Which is it, bitch?

Or maybe it's neither and you just want a man who makes no less than six figures.\n\nAnd this attitude she has about \"men hit mediocrity in their 30's\". You know what common attitude I see? People who are *never* satisfied with what they have. Sure, self-improvement is a life long process and you should always work on being a better version of you. Sure, you need to periodically seek out raises to keep up with inflation and cost-of-living increases. But why do so many people think that men must be ambitious in order to be considered men? Why must I constantly be reaching for more and more material wealth (which is what I assume she's really talking about)? What's wrong with having just enough?

Most women can't be bothered to be anything resembling moderately enthusiastic. They don't ever reach out and start conversation, even after date 1 and the worst part to me is that they don't ask questions of me when we're actually talking. It just ends up feeling like I'm asking questions at someone who couldn't care less about me and learning who I am. I need to be courted as well, and I dont like the implied assumption that women need to be won over, but that it doesn't go the other way around as well.

I’m not a country music fan at all, but the place I went to (Stoney’s Rockin Country if your curious) is known as a place that singles like to go to.

I wound up talking to three ladies that night, and here’s how it went:\n\nThe first was chilling by herself, so I commented on her shirt and hair color.  She was really cute, and we chatted for a bit, but then her two friends arrived and she excused herself to see them.  She never came back, so I let them be.\n\nThe second actually came to me and gave me props for riding the mechanical bull (which, as an aside, is A LOT harder than it looks.). She was friendly, but definitely didn’t seem like extending the conversation too much, so I said thank you and left.\n\nThe third was with a bachelorette party.  I complimented her on her back tattoo piece (I asked who did her work because I’m also looking at getting another tattoo.) and we talked a bit before she mentioned her fiancé.  I addressed the group and the bachelorette congratulating her, before I left and went home.\n\nI’m a bit disappointed I didn’t get any numbers (especially the first one, who was absolutely gorgeous, but I also give myself props for actually going out and talking to random ladies (no one else in my group did.).

We both really liked watching movies, so out of our five dates this was the third movie we watched, Phantom of the Opera (2004). I had her in my arms and she had her head resting on me and it was wonderful. After the credits rolled we stayed like that and talked for a while, then got to watching some dumb YouTube videos for a while. At this time I noticed her fingers playing along my torso feeling my muscles, she was subtle about it but I noticed and I loved that. After showing her the Monty Python defense against fruit sketch, she started to say she should be going and I kissed her. I've never kissed a girl before and it was wonderful. She melted into my arms and we sat there kissing for a long while. I thought the moment was right so I slowly started to pull up her shirt and undo her jeans but she said she wanted to take it slow so I stopped and we kissed for a long while, all while she kept saying she should be going. I even tried to get up to let her go once but she pulled me back. She asked how many relationships I had been in and I told her the truth, none. We kissed more until she really did want to go and I walked her to the door and kissed her goodnight.\n\nThe next day she didn't respond to any texts so I started to worry that my lack of relationship experience had driven her off, but on Saturday morning she texted me upset that I had started to undress her and that she felt I only wanted sex from her and now I feel terrible about that. I knew she was kind of a conservative girl, she couldn't go out in Wednesdays because that was when she had church, she came from a military family and had been in the airforce herself, and she had the cutest southern accent. Now I'm just miserable about ruining things with her when things were so great and I could have waited so long with her because everything else with her was so great.
