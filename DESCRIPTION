Description: Uses spectral network regression to estimate natural direct
    and indirect effects in network mediation settings. The estimator is 
    proceeds in two stages: first, it estimates a spectral embeddings
    of (generalized) random dot product graphs by taking low rank
    decompositions of the graph adjacency matrix and degree-normalized
    graph Laplacian. Then, it estimates two network regression using
    these embeddings and an ordinary least squares estimator. Finally,
    we combine the coefficients of the regressions to make asymptotic
    inferences about natural direct and indirect effects.
