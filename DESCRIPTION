Description: Uses spectral network regression to estimate natural direct
    and indirect effects in network mediation settings. The estimator
    proceeds in two stages: first, it estimates a spectral embeddings of
    (generalized) random dot product graphs by taking low rank
    decompositions of the graph adjacency matrix and degree-normalized
    graph Laplacian. Then, it estimates two network regression using these
    embeddings and an ordinary least squares estimator. Finally, we
    combine the coefficients of the regressions to make asymptotic
    inferences about natural direct and indirect effects.
