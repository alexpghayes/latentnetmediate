\description{
Data collected by the Lab for Big Data Methodology at the
University of Notre Dame in 2017. The participants were 162 students in a
4-year college in China. There were 90 female and 72 male students.
Their average age was 21.64 years (SD = 0.86). During the data collection,
each student indicated whether the other students were his/her friends
or not. We symmetrized the friendship network using the strongest relation
(i.e., if one of two students indicated the other as a friend,
we assumed they were mutual friends).
